# Analytics — Master Spec

## Purpose

Analytics is an experimental admin capability, gated by the `ANALYTICS_ENABLED` environment
variable, that lets an operator explore and shape analytics data held by the Analytics data-access
service (`analytics-data-access-service`, hosted at `DIAL_ANALYTICS_API_URL`). It surfaces as a
"Analytics" left-navigation group (carrying a "Preview" tag) with two pages:

- **Query Builder** — a results-first workbench: assemble a `StructuredQuery` through form controls,
  edit it as JSON, or write ad-hoc SQL in a collapsible right-side rail (Builder, JSON, and SQL are
  three views of the rail), then run it and read the result — table or chart — in the main area.
- **Tables** — a catalog of source/enrichment tables with a detail page for managing each table's
  column schema and writing rows; system-owned tables are read-only.

All transport goes through a single server-side client (`AnalyticsDataApi`) via server actions; pages
prefetch their initial data on the server and hand it to client views.

This folder (`openspec/specs/analytics/`) is the single home for all Analytics specs; this file is
the consolidated master spec, folding in the scaffold, Query Builder, SQL editor, and Tables stories.

## Requirements

### Requirement: ANALYTICS_ENABLED feature flag is surfaced on FeatureFlags

The system SHALL expose an environment variable `ANALYTICS_ENABLED` whose value is surfaced at runtime on the `FeatureFlags` object as `analyticsEnabled: boolean`. The flag MUST be `true` only when `process.env.ANALYTICS_ENABLED` is present and resolves truthy per the existing `isValueTruthy` helper; otherwise it MUST be `false`. The flag SHALL be initialized in the root layout (`app/[lang]/layout.tsx`) alongside the other feature flags and added to the `FeatureFlags` model (`models/feature-flags.ts`).

#### Scenario: Flag is true when env var is explicitly truthy

- **WHEN** `process.env.ANALYTICS_ENABLED` is set to `'true'` and the root layout initializes `FeatureFlags`
- **THEN** `featureFlags.analyticsEnabled` is `true`

#### Scenario: Flag defaults to false when env var is unset

- **WHEN** `process.env.ANALYTICS_ENABLED` is not set
- **THEN** `featureFlags.analyticsEnabled` is `false`

#### Scenario: Flag is false when env var is falsy

- **WHEN** `process.env.ANALYTICS_ENABLED` is set to `'false'`, `''`, `'0'`, or any value that `isValueTruthy` treats as falsy
- **THEN** `featureFlags.analyticsEnabled` is `false`

### Requirement: Analytics menu group with Query Builder and Tables sub-items

The left-navigation menu configuration (`MENU_CONFIGURATION` in `menu-configuration.tsx`) SHALL define an "Analytics" menu group whose sub-items are, in order, "Query Builder" (linking to the Query Builder route) and "Tables" (linking to the Tables route). The group MUST use its own icon and follow the existing `MenuGroupConfiguration` shape. Routes SHALL be present in the `ApplicationRoute` enum (`types/routes.ts`) — `/query-builder` and `/tables` — and labels SHALL exist in `MenuI18nKey` (`constants/i18n.ts`) with English strings in `locales/en.ts` ("Analytics", "Query Builder", "Tables").

#### Scenario: Group and sub-items render when flag enabled

- **WHEN** `featureFlags.analyticsEnabled` is `true` and the sidebar menu renders
- **THEN** an "Analytics" group is present
- **AND** expanding it shows a "Query Builder" sub-item linking to `/query-builder`
- **AND** it shows a "Tables" sub-item linking to `/tables`

### Requirement: Analytics menu group is gated by the feature flag

The "Analytics" group SHALL be present in the menu only when `featureFlags.analyticsEnabled` is `true`, following the same filtering pattern used for the Deployments and Evaluation groups in `MENU_CONFIGURATION`. When the flag is `false`, the entire group and both sub-items MUST be absent from the sidebar, and the group's gating MUST compose independently of every other flag-gated group (disabling or enabling any other group MUST NOT affect Analytics's visibility, and vice versa).

#### Scenario: Group hidden when flag disabled

- **WHEN** `featureFlags.analyticsEnabled` is `false` and the sidebar menu renders
- **THEN** the "Analytics" group and both its sub-items are absent from the sidebar

#### Scenario: Gating composes independently of other groups

- **WHEN** `featureFlags.analyticsEnabled` is `true` while `featureFlags.deploymentsEnabled` and `featureFlags.evaluationEnabled` are `false`
- **THEN** the "Analytics" group is present
- **AND** the Deployments and Evaluation groups are absent

### Requirement: Preview tag on the Analytics group header

The "Analytics" menu group header SHALL display the existing `PreviewTag` component. Because the preview-tag mechanism (`PREVIEW_TAG_MENU_ITEMS` in `MenuItemContent.tsx`) applies only to sub-items, the group header component (`MenuItem.tsx`) SHALL render a `PreviewTag` for groups marked as preview (an opt-in field on `MenuGroupConfiguration`). The tag MUST render only when the sidebar is expanded, and MUST NOT appear on any other group header. Sub-items ("Query Builder", "Tables") MUST NOT each carry their own preview tag.

#### Scenario: Preview tag shown on expanded group header

- **WHEN** the sidebar is expanded and the "Analytics" group is rendered
- **THEN** a "Preview" tag is shown on the "Analytics" group header
- **AND** no other group header shows a "Preview" tag

#### Scenario: Preview tag hidden when sidebar collapsed

- **WHEN** the sidebar is collapsed
- **THEN** the "Preview" tag is not rendered on the group header

### Requirement: Analytics data-access server API layer is configured

The server-side API layer SHALL provide a single typed client, `AnalyticsDataApi`, for the Analytics data-access service, hosted at `process.env.DIAL_ANALYTICS_API_URL`. The client instance SHALL be created and exported once from `app/api/api.ts` as `analyticsDataApi` (following the existing per-service instantiation pattern); the class SHALL extend `BaseApi` and live at `src/server/analytics/analytics-data-api.ts`. Request/response DTOs SHALL be placed in dedicated model files under `src/models/analytics/`. All requests SHALL send the standard auth/API headers via the existing helpers, and `{name}` path segments MUST be URL-encoded.

Queries endpoints (base path `/v1/queries`):
- `GET /v1/queries/entities` — list queryable entities
- `GET /v1/queries/entities/schema/{name}` — fetch the field schema for a named entity
- `POST /v1/queries/execute` — execute a structured query; exposed as `executeAction`, returning a `ServerActionResponse` so callers can surface an error header/message on failure
- `POST /v1/queries/execute-sql` — execute an ad-hoc SQL SELECT (body `{ sql }`); exposed as `executeSqlAction`, returning a `ServerActionResponse` with the same result envelope as `execute`
- `POST /v1/queries/translate` — translate a structured query to the external-dialect SQL subset (validation only, no execution); exposed as `translateAction`, returning a `ServerActionResponse<{ sql }>`
- `POST /v1/queries/translate-sql` — translate a SQL SELECT to the structured DSL (body `{ sql }`, validation only, no execution); exposed as `translateSqlAction`, returning a `ServerActionResponse<{ query }>`

Tables endpoints (base path `/v1/tables`):
- `GET /v1/tables` — list tables; the response is wrapped as `{ tables: [...] }` and the client SHALL unwrap it to a bare array
- `POST /v1/tables` — create a table or enrichment; **identity-only** (`{name, type, description?}`, plus `source_table` for an enrichment). It SHALL NOT send `columns` or any physical key; the created table is returned in `status=PENDING`
- `GET /v1/tables/{name}` — read one table by name
- `PUT /v1/tables/{name}` — update table catalog metadata (`description`, `tag_order`); exposed as `updateTable`, returning a `ServerActionResponse`
- `DELETE /v1/tables/{name}` — delete a table by name
- `POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema` — define the complete physical schema of a not-yet-materialized table (columns + physical keys) **and** materialize it in the same call (issues `CREATE TABLE`, flips to `ACTIVE`); exposed as `defineTableSchema`, returning a `ServerActionResponse`
- `PATCH /v1/tables/{name}/schema` — evolve a materialized (`ACTIVE`) table's columns; exposed as `updateTableSchema`
- `POST /v1/tables/{name}/rows` — insert rows into a table

#### Scenario: Client targets the Analytics data-access host

- **WHEN** `analyticsDataApi` is instantiated in `app/api/api.ts`
- **THEN** it is constructed with `host: process.env.DIAL_ANALYTICS_API_URL`

#### Scenario: Client covers the queries endpoints

- **WHEN** `analyticsDataApi` is used
- **THEN** it can issue `GET /v1/queries/entities`, `GET /v1/queries/entities/schema/{name}`, `POST /v1/queries/execute` via `executeAction`, `POST /v1/queries/execute-sql` via `executeSqlAction`, `POST /v1/queries/translate` via `translateAction`, and `POST /v1/queries/translate-sql` via `translateSqlAction`

#### Scenario: Client covers the tables endpoints

- **WHEN** `analyticsDataApi` is used
- **THEN** it can issue `GET /v1/tables` (unwrapping `{ tables }`), `POST /v1/tables` (identity-only), `GET /v1/tables/{name}`, `PUT /v1/tables/{name}` via `updateTable`, `DELETE /v1/tables/{name}`, `POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema` via `defineTableSchema`, `PATCH /v1/tables/{name}/schema` via `updateTableSchema`, and `POST /v1/tables/{name}/rows`

### Requirement: Analytics pages fetch initial data server-side

The Analytics pages SHALL be `async` server components (`export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`) that fetch their initial data on the server via server actions delegating to `analyticsDataApi`, and pass that data to a client view as props; the client view SHALL own all subsequent interactive state and re-fetching. Fetch failures SHALL be logged (`errorObjLog`); a page whose required single entity is missing SHALL call `notFound()`. Pages SHALL NOT fetch their initial data from a client-side effect.

#### Scenario: Tables catalog data is fetched on the server

- **WHEN** the user navigates to `/tables`
- **THEN** the page awaits the tables list on the server and renders the catalog view seeded with it
- **AND** if the list request fails the page resolves to a not-found result

#### Scenario: Table detail data is fetched on the server

- **WHEN** the user navigates to `/tables/{name}`
- **THEN** the page awaits that table on the server and renders the detail view seeded with it
- **AND** if the table is missing the page resolves to a not-found result

### Requirement: Query Builder layout and view switcher

The Query Builder page (`app/[lang]/query-builder/page.tsx`) SHALL render a page title, a toolbar, a main results area, and a query-builder rail on the right side of the content area. The toolbar SHALL contain the source (entity) selector, the shared time filter, and the Run action. The rail header SHALL offer three mutually exclusive views — **Builder** (form), **SQL**, and **JSON** — via a `DialSegmentedControl`; selecting a view SHALL change the rail body without a page reload and the current view SHALL be indicated. The view switcher SHALL NOT be shown before a schema is loaded. Base form controls SHALL come from the DIAL UI Kit and tabular results SHALL be displayed with the app's grid stack.

#### Scenario: Results-first layout renders

- **WHEN** the user opens `/query-builder`
- **THEN** a toolbar with source selector, time filter, and Run is shown
- **AND** the results area is the main content
- **AND** the query-builder rail is shown at the right

#### Scenario: Three views offered once a schema is loaded

- **WHEN** the page has loaded an entity schema
- **THEN** the rail header offers Builder, SQL, and JSON views
- **AND** one view is indicated as selected

#### Scenario: Switcher hidden before a schema loads

- **WHEN** no schema has been loaded yet
- **THEN** the view switcher is not shown

### Requirement: Query Builder initial data loading and state

The Query Builder page SHALL prefetch the queryable entities on the server and the first entity's schema, passing `initialEntities`, `initialEntityName`, and `initialFields` to the client builder. The client SHALL seed its `QueryBuilderState` (entity name + fields, with default mode/filter/select/sort/page) from those props without a mount-time fetch. The toolbar SHALL show the entity selector. Changing the selected entity SHALL load its schema client-side via the `getEntitySchema` server action and reset builder selections that may reference stale fields. When no entities were provided, the builder SHALL show the entities-load-failed empty state.

#### Scenario: Builder is seeded from server-fetched props

- **WHEN** the page prefetched a non-empty entities list and the first entity's schema
- **THEN** the builder renders with that entity selected and its fields available
- **AND** no client-side entities/schema request is issued on mount

#### Scenario: Changing entity reloads schema and resets selections

- **WHEN** the user selects a different (simple) entity
- **THEN** its schema is loaded client-side
- **AND** builder selections that referenced the previous schema's fields are cleared

#### Scenario: No entities provided

- **WHEN** the page provides an empty entities list
- **THEN** the builder shows the entities-load-failed empty state and no builder sections

### Requirement: Query Builder toolbar

The Query Builder page SHALL render an in-page toolbar containing, left to right: the source (entity) selector as a plain dropdown (`DialSelectField`, no schema-preview affordance), the shared time filter (`TimeFilter` with the global preset options and a custom-range picker), and the Run primary action aligned to the right.

#### Scenario: Toolbar composition

- **WHEN** the user opens the page with entities loaded
- **THEN** the toolbar shows the source dropdown, the time filter, and the Run action

### Requirement: Time range is part of the structured query

The toolbar time filter SHALL be a query control: its resolved range SHALL serialize into the structured query's filter as `ge`/`le` predicates on the source's automatically detected timestamp field (the first temporal-typed field of the loaded schema). The serialized query — as shown in the JSON view, copied by the Copy action, and executed by Run — SHALL include these predicates; nothing is added invisibly at execution time. The time predicates SHALL NOT be shown in the visual Filters tree — the toolbar control is their editor. When parsing JSON back into builder state, a matching `ge` + `le` predicate pair on the timestamp field SHALL be lifted into the toolbar control (displayed as a custom range); time conditions in any other shape or on other fields SHALL remain ordinary filter conditions. When the schema has no temporal field, no time predicates SHALL be serialized and the query runs without a time bound. SQL text SHALL never be modified by the time filter.

#### Scenario: Time range serializes into the query

- **WHEN** the user has a time range selected and the schema has a temporal field
- **THEN** the serialized query's filter includes `ge` and `le` predicates on that field for the resolved range
- **AND** the JSON view displays these predicates
- **AND** the visual Filters tree does not display them

#### Scenario: JSON time predicates round-trip into the toolbar control

- **WHEN** the user edits the JSON's `ge`/`le` predicate pair on the timestamp field to a different range and the JSON is otherwise representable
- **THEN** the toolbar time filter reflects the edited range as a custom range
- **AND** the predicates do not appear in the visual Filters tree

#### Scenario: No temporal field

- **WHEN** the loaded schema has no temporal-typed field
- **THEN** the serialized query contains no time predicates and the run is not time-bounded

#### Scenario: SQL runs are not modified

- **WHEN** the user runs a query from the SQL view
- **THEN** the executed SQL is exactly the editor text

### Requirement: Query builder rail with collapse

The query builder SHALL render in a fixed-width rail at the right edge of the content area with a header containing a collapse control and the view switcher. Collapsing SHALL hide the rail entirely and show a restore ("Query builder") button in the results-area header; restoring SHALL bring the rail back. The collapsed state SHALL be persisted in the browser's local storage under a Query-Builder-specific key and applied SSR-safely on the next visit.

#### Scenario: Collapse frees the results area

- **WHEN** the user activates the rail collapse control
- **THEN** the rail is hidden and the results area takes the full content width
- **AND** a restore button appears in the results-area header

#### Scenario: Restore brings the rail back

- **WHEN** the rail is collapsed and the user activates the restore button
- **THEN** the rail is shown again with its previous view and state

#### Scenario: Collapsed state persists

- **WHEN** the user collapses the rail and reloads the page
- **THEN** the rail is initially collapsed

### Requirement: Builder sections use section blocks with categorized field dropdowns and collapsible items

<!-- Merged from add-column-labels-and-descriptions (archived): display names, descriptions, and the bounded-width dropdown with hover tooltips. -->

Each Builder-view section (Group by, Aggregates, Select, Filters, Having, Sort, Page) SHALL render as a bordered section block with a labeled header and a header-level add action where applicable. Field pickers SHALL be searchable dropdowns whose options are grouped by the field's schema tag/category (untagged fields under a default group). Category groups SHALL be collapsible headers showing the group's option count, with at most one category expanded at a time (accordion); the group holding the current selection SHALL start expanded, and an active search term SHALL show all matches regardless of collapse state. Category header colors SHALL cycle the full builder palette. The dropdown's search input SHALL use the same compact boxed style as the builder's other controls.

Field options SHALL display the field's **display name** — the schema `display_name` when set, otherwise the field `name` — as primary text, the field type right-aligned, and the schema `description` as a secondary line when present; fields without display name and description SHALL render as a single line. The dropdown overlay width SHALL stay bounded: long descriptions truncate to one line and the full text is reachable via a hover tooltip of reasonable width. The dropdown search SHALL match against both the field name and its display name. Added items SHALL render compactly — chips for plain fields, collapsible rows for parameterized items (group-by functions, aggregates, conditions, having rows, sort keys) that expand into their editor and collapse back to a summary chip tinted with the owning section's palette color — and chips and collapsed summaries SHALL refer to fields by their display name. Display names are presentation-only: structured-query serialization, the JSON view, and the SQL view SHALL always use the raw field `name`. Styling SHALL use the project's palette/theme tokens only. A field whose schema `sensitive` flag is true SHALL show a sensitive marker (a colored dot with a "Sensitive" tooltip) in its dropdown option, after the display name.

#### Scenario: Sensitive field shows a marker in the dropdown

- **WHEN** a schema field whose `sensitive` flag is true is shown in a field dropdown
- **THEN** its option renders a sensitive marker with a "Sensitive" tooltip
- **AND** a non-sensitive field's option renders no such marker

#### Scenario: Field dropdown groups by category

- **WHEN** the user opens a field dropdown in a builder section
- **THEN** the fields are grouped under collapsible category headers with option counts
- **AND** expanding one category collapses the previously expanded one
- **AND** typing in the search shows all matching fields across categories

#### Scenario: Display-named field renders display name, description, and type

- **WHEN** the schema field `total_money` carries display name "Total money spend" and a description
- **THEN** its dropdown option shows "Total money spend" as primary text with the type right-aligned
- **AND** the description is shown as a secondary line

#### Scenario: Field without a display name falls back to its name

- **WHEN** a schema field has no display name and no description
- **THEN** its dropdown option shows the raw field name in a single line, as before

#### Scenario: Search matches the display name

- **WHEN** the user types "money" and only the field `total_money` with display name "Total money spend" matches
- **THEN** that field is shown in the results
- **AND** searching by the raw name `total_money` finds it as well

#### Scenario: Chips and summaries use the display name

- **WHEN** the user adds a projection chip and an aggregate over a field with a display name
- **THEN** the chip shows the field's display name
- **AND** the collapsed aggregate summary refers to the field by its display name
- **AND** the serialized query and the JSON view reference the raw field name

#### Scenario: Parameterized item collapses to a summary

- **WHEN** the user collapses an aggregate or filter-condition row
- **THEN** the row shows a compact summary of its configuration in its section's color
- **AND** expanding it restores the full editor

### Requirement: Served function catalog

The Query Builder SHALL source the set of functions offered in `aggregate` mode exclusively from the backend function catalog `GET /v1/queries/functions`, fetched on the server when the query-builder page loads and seeded into the builder. The frontend SHALL NOT hardcode any function name, group, argument shape, allowed literal values, numeric bound, distinct support, return type, or hint text: every such property SHALL be read from the served catalog entry. Each catalog entry provides the function `name`, `group` (`scalar`, `aggregate`, or `ordered_set_aggregate`), a `signature`, a `returns` type, a `distinct_supported` flag, a `description`, and an ordered `args` list; each argument provides its `name`, its `kind` (`expression`, `integer_literal`, `numeric_literal`, or `string_literal`), an `optional` flag, and — when applicable — `constraints` with `allowed_values` and/or `min`/`max`.

There SHALL be no local fallback catalog. When the catalog fetch fails or returns an empty list, no functions SHALL be offered: the Group by dropdown's Functions group SHALL be empty and the Aggregate section SHALL offer no metric functions, while plain-column querying (`row` mode, and plain group-by columns in `aggregate` mode) SHALL remain fully functional.

#### Scenario: Functions offered come from the served catalog

- **WHEN** the query-builder page loads and the function catalog lists `date_bin`, `width_bucket`, `lower`, `count`, `sum`, and `percentile_cont`
- **THEN** the Group by Functions group offers the `scalar` functions (`date_bin`, `width_bucket`, `lower`) and the Aggregate section offers the `aggregate` / `ordered_set_aggregate` functions (`count`, `sum`, `percentile_cont`)

#### Scenario: New backend functions appear with no frontend change

- **WHEN** the catalog advertises a function the frontend has never named (e.g. `width_bucket`, `percentile_cont`, `percentile_disc`)
- **THEN** it is offered in the appropriate section with an argument editor built from its catalog `args`, without any function-specific frontend code

#### Scenario: Absent catalog degrades to plain columns

- **WHEN** the function catalog fails to load or is empty
- **THEN** the Group by dropdown offers only schema columns and the Aggregate section offers no metric functions
- **AND** `row` mode and plain group-by columns still build and run

### Requirement: Query mode and DISTINCT

In the Builder view the rail SHALL let the user choose the query mode — `row` (projection) or `aggregate` (group + metrics) — via a two-option `DialSegmentedControl` at the top of the view. Selecting `row` SHALL show the projection (Select) section and hide the aggregate sections; selecting `aggregate` SHALL show the Group by, Aggregate, and Having sections and hide the projection section.

An aggregate metric whose catalog entry has `distinct_supported: true` SHALL render a per-aggregate DISTINCT control; aggregate metrics whose catalog entry has `distinct_supported: false` SHALL NOT render one, and there SHALL be no query-level DISTINCT toggle. When set, the control SHALL serialize into that aggregate's `distinct` flag. (This supersedes the previous rule that hid all DISTINCT controls: the served catalog now identifies exactly which functions accept `distinct`, so the control is offered precisely and only where it is valid.)

#### Scenario: Switching to aggregate mode swaps sections

- **WHEN** the user selects `aggregate` mode
- **THEN** the Group by, Aggregate, and Having sections are shown
- **AND** the projection (Select) section is hidden

#### Scenario: DISTINCT is offered only where the catalog allows it

- **WHEN** the user adds an aggregate whose catalog entry has `distinct_supported: true` (e.g. `count`, `sum`, `avg`)
- **THEN** a DISTINCT control is rendered on that aggregate row
- **AND** an aggregate whose catalog entry has `distinct_supported: false` (e.g. `min`, `max`, `percentile_cont`) renders no DISTINCT control

#### Scenario: Setting DISTINCT serializes onto the aggregate

- **WHEN** the user enables DISTINCT on a `count` aggregate over a field
- **THEN** that aggregate's serialized `fn` expression carries `distinct: true`

### Requirement: Filter (WHERE) builder with nested groups

The Filter section SHALL let the user build a WHERE tree limited to two levels: the root group holds conditions and groups, and nested groups hold only conditions. The "add nested group" action SHALL be offered only at the root group; nested groups SHALL offer only add-condition and remove actions. Each group SHALL expose a logical operator selector (AND / OR / NOT). Each condition SHALL expose a field selector (from the loaded schema, grouped by field category), an operator selector (`eq`, `ne`, `ico`, `inc`, `lt`, `gt`, `le`, `ge`, `in`), a value input, a value-type selector, and a remove action. Operators SHALL be shown as short uppercased codes (EQ, NE, LT, …); the two case-insensitive contains operators SHALL be shown with the familiar `CO`/`NC` labels while serializing to `ico`/`inc` (SQL ILIKE). The case-sensitive `co`/`nc` SHALL NOT be offered as authoring options but SHALL remain valid model values that serialize, deserialize, and round-trip without error when present in a JSON-authored or backend-translated query. For `eq`/`ne` the condition SHALL offer an "is null" option that, when set, serializes the right operand as a null value (`value_type: null`) and hides the value input. For `in` the value SHALL be entered as comma-separated tokens and serialize to an array expression of value expressions (empty tokens dropped). Empty groups and fieldless conditions SHALL be omitted; a `not` group SHALL wrap its single child, or an `and` of its children. Deeper nesting SHALL be expressible only through the SQL view.

#### Scenario: Nested group with a condition serializes

- **WHEN** the root group is AND with one condition `field eq value` and one nested OR group
- **THEN** the serialized `filter` has `op: "and"` whose args include the predicate and the nested `op: "or"` group
- **AND** groups with no conditions are omitted

#### Scenario: Nested groups cannot nest further

- **WHEN** the user inspects a nested (depth-1) group's actions
- **THEN** an add-condition action is offered
- **AND** no add-group action is offered

#### Scenario: is-null predicate

- **WHEN** a condition uses `eq` with "is null" enabled
- **THEN** the value input is hidden
- **AND** the predicate's right operand serializes as `{ "type": "value", "value_type": "null", "value": null }`

#### Scenario: in-operator builds an array

- **WHEN** a condition uses `in` with value `a, b, c`
- **THEN** the predicate's right operand serializes as an array expression with three value items

#### Scenario: Contains authoring is case-insensitive

- **WHEN** the user picks the CO (contains) operator for a condition
- **THEN** the predicate serializes with `op: "ico"`
- **AND** the case-sensitive `co`/`nc` operators are not offered in the operator selector

#### Scenario: A case-sensitive contains from an authored query still round-trips

- **WHEN** a JSON-authored or backend-translated query contains a predicate with `op: "co"`
- **THEN** it deserializes and serializes without error and is not silently changed to `ico`

### Requirement: Row-mode projection

In `row` mode the Select section SHALL let the user add projection fields through a categorized searchable dropdown; added fields SHALL render as removable chips. Added fields SHALL serialize to `select` as field-expression output columns, in selection order. When no field is added, `select` SHALL be omitted (default projection).

#### Scenario: Selected fields become projection columns

- **WHEN** the user adds two fields in row mode
- **THEN** the serialized `select` contains a field-expression output column for each added field
- **AND** each added field is shown as a chip with a remove action

#### Scenario: No projection omits select

- **WHEN** no field is added in row mode
- **THEN** the serialized query has no `select` key

### Requirement: Aggregate-mode group by, time buckets, and metrics

In `aggregate` mode the builder SHALL provide a single Group by section combining plain columns and scalar-function entries, and an Aggregate section for metrics. The functions offered SHALL be exactly those served by the function catalog (see "Served function catalog"), grouped by their catalog `group`: `scalar` functions in the Group by Functions dropdown group, and `aggregate` / `ordered_set_aggregate` functions in the Aggregate section. There SHALL be no separate Time bucket section, and no function, argument, allowed-value, or bound SHALL be hardcoded.

Picking a plain column SHALL add it as a removable chip. Picking a function SHALL add a parameterized row whose argument editors are generated from the catalog entry's ordered `args`: an `expression` argument SHALL render a field dropdown; an `integer_literal` or `numeric_literal` argument SHALL render a numeric input constrained to the argument's `min`/`max` when present; a `string_literal` argument SHALL render a select of the argument's `allowed_values` when present, otherwise a text input; an argument marked `optional` MAY be left empty and SHALL be omitted from the serialized call. Each function row SHALL also carry an alias. The row's hint text SHALL be the catalog `description`.

The serialized query SHALL place plain group-by field projections, aliased scalar-function columns, and aliased aggregate columns into `select`, and SHALL list plain group-by fields by name and function entries by alias in `group_by` (function entries without required arguments or without an alias are excluded from `group_by`). Each function argument SHALL serialize by its catalog `kind`: an `expression` argument as a field expression, and a literal argument as a value expression of the kind's type. When `aggregate` mode defines no explicit aggregate, the builder SHALL add an implicit count measure chosen from the catalog — the first `aggregate`-group function whose arguments are all optional — so grouped results still carry a value column; if the catalog has no such function, no implicit measure is added.

A function output's type (used to type Having and Sort options) SHALL be taken from the catalog `returns`; a `same_as_argument` return SHALL be resolved to the type of the function's first `expression` argument as declared in the entity schema.

#### Scenario: Aggregate select and group_by are built

- **WHEN** the user adds a group-by column and a `sum` aggregate over a field with alias `total`
- **THEN** `select` includes the group-by field column and a `sum` function column aliased `total`
- **AND** `group_by` includes the group-by field

#### Scenario: date_bin builds through the generic argument editor

- **WHEN** the user picks `date_bin` from the Group by Functions group and its catalog args are `amount` (`integer_literal`, `min` 1), `unit` (`string_literal`, `allowed_values`), and `timestamp` (`expression`), and sets 5 / `minute` / a timestamp field with alias `bucket`
- **THEN** the amount arg renders a numeric input floored at 1, the unit arg renders a select of the advertised units, and the timestamp arg renders a field dropdown
- **AND** `select` includes a `date_bin` function column aliased `bucket` whose args serialize as an integer value, a string value, and a field expression
- **AND** `group_by` includes `bucket`

#### Scenario: Multi-argument scalar function builds

- **WHEN** the user picks `width_bucket` whose catalog declares four `expression` args (`operand`, `low`, `high`, `count`) and fills each with a field, aliased `bkt`
- **THEN** the row renders four field dropdowns and `select` includes a `width_bucket` column aliased `bkt` with four field-expression args

#### Scenario: Ordered-set aggregate with a bounded literal builds

- **WHEN** the user picks `percentile_cont` whose catalog declares a `fraction` (`numeric_literal`, `min` 0, `max` 1) and a `column` (`expression`) argument
- **THEN** the fraction arg renders a numeric input constrained to `[0, 1]` and the column arg renders a field dropdown
- **AND** the serialized aggregate carries a numeric value arg and a field-expression arg

#### Scenario: Function select entries parse back into the correct section

- **WHEN** a JSON query's `select` holds a `scalar` catalog function column and an `ordered_set_aggregate` catalog function column
- **THEN** switching views shows the scalar one as a Group by function row and the ordered-set one as an Aggregate row

#### Scenario: Implicit measure is chosen from the catalog

- **WHEN** the user builds an `aggregate` query with a group-by column and no explicit aggregate
- **THEN** the serialized `select` includes an implicit measure that is the first catalog `aggregate`-group function whose arguments are all optional (`count`), aliased with the implicit count alias

### Requirement: Aggregate-mode HAVING builder

In `aggregate` mode the builder SHALL provide a Having section using the same nested group/condition builder as the Filter section, but whose selectable fields are the aggregate output names — the checked group-by fields, the bucket aliases, and the aggregate aliases. The built tree SHALL serialize to the query's `having` node under the same rules as the filter tree.

#### Scenario: Having references an aggregate alias

- **WHEN** an aggregate is aliased `total` and the user adds a Having condition `total gt 100`
- **THEN** the field selector for that condition offers `total`
- **AND** the serialized query includes a `having` node with that predicate

### Requirement: Sort keys

The Sort section SHALL let the user add, edit, and remove sort keys, each with a field, a direction (`asc` / `desc`), and an optional nulls ordering (default / nulls first / nulls last). The nulls select trigger SHALL carry a dimmed "Nulls:" prefix so its role is readable next to the direction select. In `row` mode the field options SHALL be the schema fields; in `aggregate` mode they SHALL be the aggregate output names (group-by columns, function-entry aliases, aggregate aliases). Fieldless sort keys SHALL be omitted, and `sort` SHALL be omitted entirely when no valid key remains; the nulls ordering SHALL be omitted when left at default.

#### Scenario: Sort key serializes

- **WHEN** the user adds a sort key on a field with direction `desc`
- **THEN** the serialized `sort` contains an item with that field and `dir: "desc"`

#### Scenario: Nulls control names itself

- **WHEN** the user inspects a sort key row
- **THEN** the nulls select shows a "Nulls:" prefix before the selected value

### Requirement: Paging

The Page section SHALL provide an "include page" toggle and a paging strategy selector (`offset` or `cursor`). For `offset` the controls SHALL be offset, limit, and an `include_total` toggle; for `cursor` the controls SHALL be a cursor value and a limit. The serialized `page` object SHALL match the selected strategy, and SHALL be omitted entirely when "include page" is off.

#### Scenario: Offset paging serializes

- **WHEN** "include page" is on with strategy `offset`, offset `0`, limit `25`, include_total off
- **THEN** `page` is `{ "type": "offset", "offset": 0, "limit": 25, "include_total": false }`

#### Scenario: Paging omitted when disabled

- **WHEN** "include page" is off
- **THEN** the serialized query has no `page` key

### Requirement: JSON view and copy

The JSON view SHALL render the current serialized `StructuredQuery` as JSON in a Monaco editor. Editing the JSON to a valid query the builder can represent SHALL parse it back into the builder state so the Builder view reflects the last such JSON; invalid JSON SHALL be flagged non-blockingly and SHALL disable Run while invalid. Valid JSON that the visual builder cannot represent (e.g. filter nesting deeper than two levels) SHALL remain fully editable and runnable: a non-blocking informational message SHALL state that the query cannot be shown in the visual builder, Run SHALL stay enabled and SHALL execute the JSON query as written, and the builder state SHALL NOT be updated from that JSON (switching to the Builder view is guarded by the written-mode confirmation). Entering the JSON view SHALL seed the editor from the current builder state. The Copy action SHALL copy the currently displayed query text (JSON for the Builder/JSON views, the SQL text for the SQL view).

#### Scenario: JSON reflects the form and round-trips

- **WHEN** the user edits the form, switches to the JSON view, and edits the JSON to valid content the builder can represent
- **THEN** the JSON initially mirrors the form
- **AND** the edited valid JSON is parsed back so the form reflects it

#### Scenario: Invalid JSON is flagged and blocks Run

- **WHEN** the JSON editor contains invalid JSON
- **THEN** a non-blocking invalid-JSON message is shown
- **AND** the Run action is disabled

#### Scenario: Unrepresentable JSON stays runnable

- **WHEN** the JSON editor contains a valid query whose filter nests deeper than two levels
- **THEN** a non-blocking message states the query cannot be shown in the visual builder
- **AND** the Run action stays enabled and executes the JSON query as written
- **AND** the builder state is not updated from that JSON

### Requirement: Aggregate validation warnings

While in `aggregate` mode the builder SHALL surface non-blocking warnings when: any aggregate lacks an alias; any Group by function entry lacks a source field or an alias; or the query has no group-by entries or aggregates. The warnings SHALL clear when resolved and SHALL NOT prevent running the query.

#### Scenario: Missing aggregate alias warns

- **WHEN** in aggregate mode an aggregate has no alias
- **THEN** a warning states that every aggregate needs an alias

#### Scenario: Missing function alias warns

- **WHEN** a Group by function entry has a field but no alias
- **THEN** a warning states that every group-by function needs an alias

#### Scenario: Warnings clear when resolved

- **WHEN** the aggregate gains an alias
- **THEN** the corresponding warning is no longer shown

### Requirement: Run query and result

The toolbar Run action SHALL execute the current query and render the result in the main results area. In the Builder view the query is the serialized `StructuredQuery` from the builder state; in the JSON view it is the query as written in the editor — both executed via a server action delegating to `analyticsDataApi.executeAction` (`/v1/queries/execute`). The result SHALL be shown as a grid whose columns are derived from the returned result (the result's declared columns when present, otherwise the union of keys across the returned rows), with object/array cell values stringified. Before any run, the results area SHALL show an empty state inviting the user to run the query. An empty result SHALL show an empty-state message. A failed run SHALL surface an error via the app's notification convention and SHALL NOT replace a previously shown result with a broken grid. Run SHALL be disabled until a schema is loaded and while the JSON view contains invalid (unparseable) JSON.

#### Scenario: Successful run renders a result grid

- **WHEN** the user runs a valid query that returns rows
- **THEN** the rows are shown in a grid in the main results area with a column per result column

#### Scenario: Empty state before the first run

- **WHEN** the page is open and no query has been run yet
- **THEN** the results area shows an empty state inviting the user to run the query

#### Scenario: Empty result

- **WHEN** a run returns no rows
- **THEN** an empty-state message is shown instead of a grid

#### Scenario: Failed run surfaces an error

- **WHEN** a run fails
- **THEN** an error notification is shown
- **AND** the previous result (if any) is not replaced by a broken grid

### Requirement: Result stat tiles

When a result is shown, the results area SHALL display a stat-tile row above the result with: the number of returned rows, the number of result columns (Fields), and — when the response includes a total count — the Total. The service computes `totalCount` only for row-mode offset paging with `include_total=true`, so the Include total toggle SHALL be offered only in row mode with offset paging, and aggregate/SQL results never show a Total tile. No timing tile SHALL be shown (the backend does not report query timing).

#### Scenario: Tiles reflect the result

- **WHEN** a run returns 12 rows with 5 columns and no total
- **THEN** the stat tiles show Rows 12 and Fields 5
- **AND** no Total tile is shown

#### Scenario: Total appears when reported

- **WHEN** a row-mode offset-paged run requested a total and the response includes one
- **THEN** a Total tile shows the reported total

#### Scenario: Include total is offered only where the service supports it

- **WHEN** the builder is in aggregate mode (or cursor paging is selected)
- **THEN** the Include total toggle is not shown

### Requirement: Result table and chart views

The results area SHALL offer a Table ⇄ Chart switcher. The Table view SHALL render the result grid. Each result column SHALL render its row's actual value looked up by its exact column name, including a column name that itself contains a literal `.` (for example an enrichment projection's `table.column`) — such a name SHALL NOT be treated as a nested-path lookup. The Chart view SHALL render the result with ECharts and offer a chart-type control with four types — bar, line, pie, and scatter — plus two column selectors whose allowed columns and labels follow the selected type. The Chart view SHALL be available only when the shown result came from an aggregate-mode structured run with at least one group-by or bucket column; otherwise the Chart view SHALL show a hint that charts require an aggregate result with a group-by. Chart colors SHALL come from the shared chart color tokens.

For **bar** and **line**, the selectors SHALL be labeled X axis and Y axis: X over the executed query's group-by/bucket columns, Y over its aggregate columns (including the count column when present); defaults SHALL be the first dimension and the first aggregate. When every X value is numeric or date-like, the chart SHALL order the points along the X axis by that natural order (chronological/numeric ascending) regardless of the query's row order; mixed or plain-text X values keep row order. Long X-axis labels SHALL be truncated to a fixed label width with the full value available in the tooltip.

For **pie**, the same two selectors SHALL be labeled Category (group-by/bucket columns) and Value (aggregate columns). The chart SHALL show at most the top 10 categories by value as slices; any remaining categories SHALL be merged into a single "Other" slice.

For **scatter**, both selectors SHALL be labeled X axis and Y axis and SHALL offer the result's numeric columns — the group-by/bucket and aggregate columns whose every value is numeric or date-like. Each result row (one group) SHALL render as one point, with the row's dimension values available in the point tooltip; scatter SHALL NOT re-order rows. The scatter type SHALL be offered only when the result has at least two numeric columns; otherwise it is hidden from the chart-type control.

Switching chart type SHALL keep a column pick that is valid for the new type's selector and SHALL fall back to that selector's first valid default otherwise.

Everywhere the chart names a column — selector options, in-chart axis titles, and point tooltips — a group-by/bucket column SHALL display by its schema display name when the executed entity defines one (raw name otherwise); aggregate and scalar-function columns display by their user-authored alias. The labels SHALL follow the executed query's entity, not the currently selected source.

#### Scenario: Chart columns display by their schema display name

- **WHEN** an aggregate result grouped by a column whose schema defines a display name is charted
- **THEN** the axis selector and the chart axis title show the display name instead of the raw column name
- **AND** aggregate columns keep their user-authored aliases

#### Scenario: Chart renders for an aggregate result

- **WHEN** the shown result came from an aggregate run grouped by one field and the user selects the Chart view
- **THEN** a chart renders with the group-by column on X and an aggregate column on Y
- **AND** the user can switch between bar, line, pie, and scatter types

#### Scenario: Pie buckets the long tail into Other

- **WHEN** an aggregate result has more than 10 category values and the user selects the pie type
- **THEN** the pie shows the top 10 categories by value as slices
- **AND** the remaining categories are merged into a single "Other" slice

#### Scenario: Scatter plots one point per group

- **WHEN** an aggregate result grouped by one field has two aggregate columns and the user selects the scatter type
- **THEN** each group renders as one point with one aggregate on X and the other on Y
- **AND** the point tooltip shows the group's dimension value

#### Scenario: Scatter requires two numeric columns

- **WHEN** the shown aggregate result has only one numeric column
- **THEN** the scatter type is not offered in the chart-type control

#### Scenario: Column picks survive a compatible type switch

- **WHEN** the user configured Category and Value on a pie and switches to the bar type
- **THEN** the same columns stay selected as X and Y

#### Scenario: Comparable X values are ordered on the axis

- **WHEN** a top-N-by-count aggregate result has time-bucket X values and the user opens the Chart view
- **THEN** the chart shows the buckets in chronological order along the X axis
- **AND** the table keeps the query's row order

#### Scenario: Chart hint for non-aggregate results

- **WHEN** the shown result came from a row-mode or SQL run and the user selects the Chart view
- **THEN** a hint explains that charts require an aggregate result with a group-by

#### Scenario: A dotted column name still shows its value

- **WHEN** a result row includes a column whose name contains a literal `.` (e.g. an enrichment projection) and the backend response carries a value for it
- **THEN** the Table view shows that value in the corresponding cell rather than leaving it blank

### Requirement: Backend-authoritative query translation

The Query Builder SHALL treat the Analytics data-access service as the single source of truth for translating between the structured query DSL and SQL, via two validation-only endpoints that never run against ClickHouse. The server API layer SHALL expose `translateAction(query)` for `POST /v1/queries/translate` (DSL → SQL, success body `{ "sql": <text> }`) and `translateSqlAction(sql)` for `POST /v1/queries/translate-sql` (SQL → DSL, success body `{ "query": <StructuredQuery> }`), each returning a `ServerActionResponse` envelope and reached through a server action injecting the user token. The frontend SHALL NOT generate SQL from the structured query on the client; the client-side generator is removed. When the backend rejects a translation with a `400` (a DSL the SQL subset cannot express, or SQL that is unparseable or uses an unsupported construct), the failure SHALL be handled per the consuming requirement (SQL-view seeding surfaces the error; the Builder switch falls back to the discard guard) and SHALL NOT be presented as a successful translation.

#### Scenario: DSL is translated to SQL through the backend

- **WHEN** the SQL view needs to seed its editor from the current builder query
- **THEN** the structured query is sent to `POST /v1/queries/translate`
- **AND** the returned `{ sql }` text is used verbatim as the editor contents

#### Scenario: SQL is translated to a structured query through the backend

- **WHEN** SQL is translated for display in the visual builder
- **THEN** the SQL is sent to `POST /v1/queries/translate-sql`
- **AND** the returned `{ query }` is a structured query the `execute` endpoint would accept

#### Scenario: A DSL the SQL subset cannot express is rejected

- **WHEN** `POST /v1/queries/translate` is called for a query the SQL subset cannot express (for example `include_total`)
- **THEN** the backend responds `400`
- **AND** the frontend surfaces the failure rather than showing generated SQL

### Requirement: SQL view shows only a SQL editor

In the SQL view the rail SHALL render a SQL code editor filling the rail body, and SHALL NOT render the Mode, Filter, Select, Group by, Aggregate, Having, Sort, or Page sections. The source selector remains available in the toolbar. The editor SHALL provide SQL syntax highlighting (via the Monaco `sql` language). The Copy and Run actions SHALL remain available; Copy SHALL copy the SQL editor text.

#### Scenario: SQL view hides the builder sections

- **WHEN** the user selects the SQL view
- **THEN** a SQL editor is shown in the rail
- **AND** none of the Mode, Filter, Select, aggregate, Sort, or Page sections are shown

#### Scenario: SQL text is highlighted

- **WHEN** the user types a SQL statement in the SQL editor
- **THEN** the statement is rendered with SQL syntax highlighting

### Requirement: Schema-aware SQL autocomplete

The SQL editor SHALL offer completion suggestions derived from the loaded schema and a fixed SQL catalog: the loaded schema's field names (each annotated with its field type), the selected entity name (as the query's source/`FROM` target), and the supported SQL keywords and functions. The keyword catalog SHALL include both `LIKE` (case-sensitive contains) and `ILIKE` (case-insensitive contains). Suggestions SHALL reflect the schema currently loaded, so changing the selected entity SHALL change the suggested field names and source name. The autocomplete SHALL NOT perform SQL validation.

#### Scenario: Schema fields are suggested

- **WHEN** the user triggers completion in the SQL editor with a schema loaded
- **THEN** the loaded schema's field names are offered as suggestions
- **AND** each field suggestion shows its field type
- **AND** the selected entity name is offered as the source

#### Scenario: Suggestions follow the selected entity

- **WHEN** the user selects a different entity and triggers completion
- **THEN** the suggested field names are those of the newly selected entity's schema

#### Scenario: ILIKE is offered as a keyword

- **WHEN** the user triggers keyword completion in the SQL editor
- **THEN** both `LIKE` and `ILIKE` are offered as suggestions

### Requirement: SQL execution via the SQL endpoint

Running a query in the SQL view SHALL execute the editor's SQL text against `POST /v1/queries/execute-sql` through a server action (`executeSqlQuery`) delegating to `analyticsDataApi.executeSqlAction`, sending the statement as `{ "sql": <text> }`. On success the returned rows SHALL be shown in the same result grid used by the structured Run. Because the SQL endpoint never returns a total count, no total SHALL be shown for SQL results. Run SHALL be disabled until a schema is loaded and while the SQL editor is empty.

#### Scenario: SQL run renders a result grid

- **WHEN** the user runs a valid SQL SELECT that returns rows
- **THEN** the request is sent to `/v1/queries/execute-sql` with body `{ "sql": <the editor text> }`
- **AND** the returned rows are shown in the result grid with a row-count meta line

#### Scenario: Run disabled for empty SQL

- **WHEN** the SQL editor is empty
- **THEN** the Run action is disabled

### Requirement: SQL validation is backend-authoritative

The SQL view SHALL NOT perform client-side SQL parsing or validation. When the backend rejects the SQL (a `400` — parse/validation failure or an unsupported construct such as a join, CTE, subquery, arithmetic, `CAST`, or a `LIMIT` above the maximum), the failure SHALL surface via the app's notification convention (error header/message), and a previously shown result SHALL NOT be replaced by a broken grid.

#### Scenario: Rejected SQL surfaces an error

- **WHEN** the user runs SQL that the backend rejects with a `400`
- **THEN** an error notification is shown with the backend's message
- **AND** any previously shown result is not replaced by a broken grid

### Requirement: SQL view state is an independent buffer

The Query Builder SHALL keep the SQL editor text as its own buffer. Entering the SQL view SHALL seed the editor by translating the current builder query (including the toolbar time bound and the implicit count) to SQL via `POST /v1/queries/translate` through a server action, when the buffer is empty or still matches the last generated text; the seed is asynchronous and the editor SHALL show a loading affordance while the translation is in flight. When the translation is rejected (`400` — a query the SQL subset cannot express), the failure SHALL surface via the app's error-notification convention and the editor SHALL be left empty (with Run disabled), rather than being seeded with a locally generated or partial statement. User-edited SQL SHALL never be overwritten by a re-seed. Switching between the SQL and JSON views SHALL NOT prompt and SHALL leave both buffers intact.

#### Scenario: Entering SQL translates the builder query via the backend

- **WHEN** the user opens the SQL view without prior SQL edits
- **THEN** the current builder query is sent to `POST /v1/queries/translate`
- **AND** the editor is pre-filled with the returned SQL, auto-formatted for readability (see "SQL editor auto-formatting")

#### Scenario: A non-expressible query surfaces a translate error

- **WHEN** the user opens the SQL view for a query the SQL subset cannot express and the backend responds `400`
- **THEN** an error notification is shown with the backend's message
- **AND** the SQL editor is left empty and Run is disabled

#### Scenario: SQL text persists across written-mode switches

- **WHEN** the user edits SQL, switches to the JSON view, and switches back to the SQL view
- **THEN** the SQL editor shows the previously edited text unchanged
- **AND** the edited text is not re-translated over

### Requirement: SQL editor auto-formatting

The SQL editor SHALL auto-format its contents — there SHALL be no manual "Format" action. Formatting SHALL apply: when text is seeded into the editor (the translated builder query, or SQL returned from a rejected-JSON fallback), as the user types, and as the user pastes, using the Monaco `sql` language's document-formatting provider backed by the `sql-formatter` library. A syntax error in the current text SHALL leave that text unformatted rather than throwing or clearing it. Formatting is a display concern only: the text actually executed or copied is whatever the editor currently holds (the formatted text), and translating that SQL back to a structured query (see "Switching from a written mode to the Builder is guarded") is unaffected by whitespace/formatting differences.

#### Scenario: Typed SQL is auto-formatted

- **WHEN** the user types a SQL statement in the editor
- **THEN** the statement is reformatted without a manual Format action

#### Scenario: Pasted SQL is auto-formatted

- **WHEN** the user pastes a SQL statement into the editor
- **THEN** the pasted text is reformatted in place

#### Scenario: Seeded SQL is pre-formatted

- **WHEN** the editor is seeded from the translated builder query
- **THEN** the seeded text is already formatted, with no separate user action required

#### Scenario: Unformattable text is left as-is

- **WHEN** the editor's current text is not valid SQL
- **THEN** formatting leaves the text unchanged rather than erroring

### Requirement: Switching from a written mode to the Builder is guarded

SQL and JSON are "written" modes: they can hold queries the visual builder cannot display (edited SQL text; JSON with e.g. filter nesting deeper than two levels). When the user switches from the SQL view to the Builder view with an edited SQL buffer, the SQL SHALL first be translated to the structured DSL via `POST /v1/queries/translate-sql`. If the translation succeeds and the resulting query is representable in the two-level visual builder, the builder SHALL be hydrated from that query and the view SHALL switch with no confirmation and no data loss. If the translation fails (`400` — parse failure or an unsupported construct) or the resulting query is not builder-representable, a confirmation popup (danger variant) SHALL warn that switching will drop the current query and reset the builder to its starting point. From the JSON view the same guard applies when the JSON is valid but unrepresentable. Confirming SHALL discard the written query (clear the SQL buffer / discard the JSON edits), reset the builder state to its initial defaults for the selected entity, and switch to the Builder view. Cancelling SHALL keep the user in the written mode with the query intact. Switching to the Builder SHALL NOT prompt when nothing would be lost (empty or unedited generated SQL; SQL that translates to a representable query; JSON that round-trips into the builder).

#### Scenario: Translatable SQL hydrates the builder without a prompt

- **WHEN** the user edits SQL that translates to a builder-representable query and selects the Builder view
- **THEN** no confirmation is shown
- **AND** the builder reflects the translated query
- **AND** the SQL buffer is cleared

#### Scenario: Untranslatable SQL asks for confirmation

- **WHEN** the user edits SQL that the backend rejects (or that translates to an unrepresentable query) and selects the Builder view
- **THEN** a confirmation popup warns that the current query will be dropped and the builder reset

#### Scenario: Confirming drops the written query and resets the builder

- **WHEN** the confirmation popup is shown and the user confirms
- **THEN** the view switches to the Builder view
- **AND** the written query is discarded
- **AND** the builder state is reset to its initial defaults for the selected entity

#### Scenario: Cancelling keeps the written query

- **WHEN** the confirmation popup is shown and the user cancels
- **THEN** the user remains in the written mode
- **AND** the written query text is unchanged

#### Scenario: Representable JSON switches silently

- **WHEN** the JSON editor holds a valid query the builder can represent and the user selects the Builder view
- **THEN** no confirmation is shown
- **AND** the builder reflects that query

### Requirement: Tables catalog page

The Tables page SHALL render the tables the page fetched as a grid with columns for name, type, description, column count, and lifecycle status. The status SHALL be shown with the table status badge (Draft / Active / Failed). Clicking a row (other than the actions column) SHALL navigate to that table's detail page. Each row SHALL offer an action menu with **edit** and **delete** entries, mirroring the columns grid's own per-row action menu (one kebab icon; both entries hidden for system-owned tables); delete's confirmation dialog SHALL use the danger (red confirm) variant. The **edit** action SHALL open the table-metadata edit surface (see "Table metadata editing"). The header SHALL provide actions to create a source table and to create an enrichment table. After a successful create, edit, or delete the catalog SHALL refresh client-side.

#### Scenario: Catalog lists tables with navigation

- **WHEN** the catalog renders with tables
- **THEN** each table appears as a row with its name, type, description, column count, and status badge
- **AND** clicking a row navigates to that table's detail page

#### Scenario: Draft and active tables are visually distinct

- **WHEN** the catalog lists a `PENDING`/`FAILED` table and an `ACTIVE` table
- **THEN** the draft/failed table shows a non-active status badge and the active table shows the active badge

#### Scenario: Row action menu offers edit and delete

- **WHEN** a non-system row's action menu is opened
- **THEN** it offers an edit entry (table metadata) and a delete entry
- **AND** a system-owned table's row offers neither

#### Scenario: Delete a table

- **WHEN** the user activates a row's delete action and confirms in the red confirmation dialog
- **THEN** the table is deleted and the catalog refreshes
- **AND** a failure surfaces an error notification without navigating away

### Requirement: Create table (source or enrichment)

Creating a table SHALL open a form popup that is mounted only while open, so closing discards its state without a manual reset; the form SHALL be held as a single object seeded when the popup opens (enrichment defaults derived from the first source table). Create SHALL be **identity-only**: a **source** table SHALL collect a name and optional description; an **enrichment** table SHALL collect a name, optional description, and a source table. The popup SHALL NOT collect columns, ordering key, partition, or grain key — the physical schema is defined afterwards on the table detail view. Submit SHALL build the type-discriminated identity-only create payload, and on success SHALL show a success notification and route to the created table's detail view; the created table is in `PENDING` (not yet materialized) status.

#### Scenario: Popup state is discarded on close

- **WHEN** the user opens the create popup, edits fields, and closes it
- **THEN** re-opening the popup shows a fresh, empty form

#### Scenario: Create sends identity only

- **WHEN** the user creates a source (name + optional description) or an enrichment (name + source table + optional description) and submits
- **THEN** the create payload carries only identity/metadata fields and no `columns` or physical key
- **AND** on success the user is routed to the new table's detail view, which shows the table as a draft (`PENDING`)

#### Scenario: Enrichment requires a source table

- **WHEN** the user opens the create-enrichment popup
- **THEN** it offers a source-table selection whose value is required to submit

### Requirement: Table detail column schema management

The Table detail page SHALL branch on the table's lifecycle `status`. The **live** column-management surface described here SHALL be offered only when the table is `ACTIVE`; for a `PENDING`/`FAILED` table the detail view SHALL instead offer the schema-definition surface (see "Define and materialize a table schema"). The detail header SHALL show the table's name and status badge regardless of status, and, when the table has a `description`, the description SHALL be shown beneath them regardless of status too (truncated with the full value reachable via an ellipsis tooltip, as elsewhere long text is truncated).

While the table is `ACTIVE`, the header SHALL also show a read-only schema-metadata summary: for a **source** table, its ordering key when set and its partition column and granularity together when a partition is set; for an **enrichment** table, its grain key when set. This summary SHALL NOT be shown for a `PENDING`/`FAILED` table, which instead exposes the same fields as editable inputs in the schema-definition surface.

For an `ACTIVE` table, the detail page SHALL show the table's columns in a grid (name, type, tag, display name, description, nullable rendered as a true/false value); the physical source name SHALL NOT be shown as its own grid column — it is an internal identifier surfaced only where an operation requires it (see "Table detail row writes", whose insert template must key by source name). Long display name/description values SHALL be truncated with the full value reachable via an ellipsis tooltip. A column whose `sensitive` flag is true SHALL show a marker (a colored dot with a "Sensitive" tooltip) rendered inline in the name cell, after the name; non-sensitive columns SHALL show no marker. Each column row SHALL offer a per-column action menu with **edit** and **delete (drop)** actions. The column name SHALL also be editable inline in the grid — this SHALL rename the column's exposed name only; the immutable physical source name is unaffected.

For an **enrichment** table, the columns grid SHALL additionally show the table's grain key as a pinned, non-editable row at the top of the grid — it carries no action menu and its name is not inline-editable. Because the grain key is never included in the table's declared `columns` (the backend derives its physical type from the matching column on the enrichment's source table and never exposes it as an ordinary column), the pinned row's type/tag/display-name metadata SHALL be backfilled by looking up the source table's column of the same name; when no matching source column is found, the row SHALL still render (name only, blank type/tag/display name) rather than being omitted.

The edit action SHALL open a unified edit modal seeded with the column's current name, display name, tag, description, and sensitive flag. The name field SHALL be required (submit disabled while blank) and SHALL be disabled for columns the backend does not allow to rename (grain-key, ordering-key, and `_`-prefixed system columns) while the metadata fields remain editable. Blank display name, tag, or description values SHALL be valid input meaning "clear the value"; the sensitive flag SHALL be toggled with a switch. On submit the modal SHALL diff the form against the original column and send a **single** schema patch: a structural `rename` op when the name changed, plus a **single `update` merge-patch entry** carrying the target column name and only the metadata fields (tag, display name, description, sensitive) that changed. Within the `update` entry an omitted field leaves that attribute unchanged, a blank string value clears it, a non-blank string value sets it, and the boolean `sensitive` is sent as `true`/`false` when toggled. When a rename is included, the `update` entry SHALL reference the new (post-rename) column name. Submit SHALL be disabled when no field changed.

Adding columns SHALL be available from the header via a form popup reusing the column-row editor, including its element-type control and disabled-Nullable behavior for Array-typed rows (see "Define and materialize a table schema"). Every live schema change SHALL be sent as a schema patch to `updateTableSchema` (`PATCH /v1/tables/{name}/schema`), and on success the detail view SHALL refresh from the server. Deleting the whole table and editing its catalog metadata (description/tag order) SHALL NOT be offered from this view — both live only in the catalog list's row action menu (see "Tables catalog page").

#### Scenario: Live column surface only for materialized tables

- **WHEN** the detail view renders a `PENDING` or `FAILED` table
- **THEN** the live add/drop/rename/edit column surface and the write-rows action are not offered (the schema-definition surface is shown instead)
- **AND** when the table is `ACTIVE` the live column surface is offered

#### Scenario: Inline rename patches the schema

- **WHEN** the user edits an `ACTIVE` table column's name in the grid to a new non-empty value
- **THEN** a rename schema patch is sent and the grid refreshes with the server state

#### Scenario: Combined edit sends one patch with post-rename names

- **WHEN** the user renames `total_money` to `total_cost` and sets its display name to "Total money spend" in the edit modal and submits
- **THEN** a single schema patch is sent containing a rename from `total_money` to `total_cost` and an `update` entry whose `name` is `total_cost` and `display_name` is "Total money spend"
- **AND** the grid refreshes with the server state

#### Scenario: Only changed fields become update fields

- **WHEN** the user changes only the display name and leaves name, tag, and description untouched
- **THEN** the patch contains a single `update` entry carrying only `name` and `display_name`, with no `tag` or `description` field

#### Scenario: Blank metadata clears the value

- **WHEN** the user clears the display name field and submits
- **THEN** the `update` entry sends `display_name` as an empty string, clearing the stored display name

#### Scenario: Sensitive columns are marked in the grid

- **WHEN** the columns grid renders a column whose `sensitive` flag is true
- **THEN** the name cell shows a marker with a "Sensitive" tooltip after the name
- **AND** a column whose flag is false shows no marker

#### Scenario: Drop a column

- **WHEN** the user chooses delete from a column's action menu
- **THEN** a drop schema patch is sent and the column is removed after refresh

#### Scenario: Add columns

- **WHEN** the user adds one or more valid columns in the add-columns popup and submits
- **THEN** an add schema patch is sent and the new columns appear after refresh

#### Scenario: Adding an array column requires an element type

- **WHEN** the user adds a column typed Array in the add-columns popup without choosing an element type
- **THEN** submit is disabled until an element type is chosen

#### Scenario: Table description shown under the header

- **WHEN** a table (of any status) has a non-empty `description`
- **THEN** the description is shown under the name and status badge
- **AND** a table with no description shows nothing in its place

#### Scenario: Source table shows its schema metadata summary

- **WHEN** an `ACTIVE` **source** table with an ordering key and a partition set renders
- **THEN** its ordering key, partition column, and granularity are all shown
- **AND** an `ACTIVE` source table with no partition shows only its ordering key

#### Scenario: Enrichment table shows its grain key summary

- **WHEN** an `ACTIVE` **enrichment** table renders
- **THEN** its grain key is shown in the header summary

#### Scenario: Enrichment grid pins the grain key with backfilled metadata

- **WHEN** an `ACTIVE` enrichment table's columns grid renders and its source table has a column matching the grain key's name
- **THEN** the grid shows the grain key as a pinned row at the top, with that source column's type, tag, and display name
- **AND** the pinned row offers no action menu and its name is not inline-editable

#### Scenario: Enrichment grid pins the grain key even without a source-column match

- **WHEN** the enrichment's source table has no column matching the grain key's name
- **THEN** the pinned row still renders, showing the grain key name with blank type, tag, and display name

### Requirement: Table detail gates edits by per-table permissions

The table detail view (`components/Analytics/Tables/TableDetailView.tsx`) SHALL gate its mutating affordances independently:

- **Manage access** SHALL be shown only when `canManageRoles` (`FULL_ADMIN` and non-system).
- **Delete table** SHALL be shown only when `canDelete` (`FULL_ADMIN` and non-system).
- For an `ACTIVE` table, **Add rows** (inserting rows) and **Add columns** (schema evolution) SHALL be offered as items of a single header **Add** dropdown rather than two standalone buttons; **Add rows** SHALL be shown only when `canWrite`, **Add columns** only when `canModify`, and the dropdown itself SHALL NOT render when neither is available.
- Per-column **edit/drop** (grid action column), **inline column rename**, column-metadata edits, and **description edits** SHALL be shown only when `canModify`.
- Header actions SHALL be ordered **Manage access, Delete table, Add** (a not-yet-`ACTIVE` table shows **Save** in place of **Add** — see "Define and materialize a table schema").

Because the backend reports `permissions {false,false}` for system tables, the write/modify-gated affordances (Add rows, Add columns, per-column edit/drop, inline rename, description edits) hide for system tables without a separate check. **Manage access** and **Delete table** are gated on `FULL_ADMIN`, which the backend does not scope per-table, so each carries its own explicit `!table.system` check.

#### Scenario: Write-capable, not modify-capable

- **WHEN** a table reports `permissions {write:true, modify:false}`
- **THEN** the header **Add** dropdown offers **Add rows** but not **Add columns**, and the per-column action column and inline rename are absent

#### Scenario: Modify-capable, not write-capable

- **WHEN** a table reports `permissions {write:false, modify:true}`
- **THEN** the schema-edit affordances and per-column action column are present, and the header **Add** dropdown offers **Add columns** but not **Add rows**

#### Scenario: Neither capability hides the Add dropdown entirely

- **WHEN** a table reports `permissions {write:false, modify:false}`
- **THEN** the header **Add** dropdown is not rendered at all

#### Scenario: Delete stays admin-only

- **WHEN** a non-system table reports edit permissions but the user is not `FULL_ADMIN`
- **THEN** the "Delete table" button is absent

#### Scenario: Manage access is hidden for a system table even for a full admin

- **WHEN** a `FULL_ADMIN` opens a system table's detail page
- **THEN** the "Manage access" button is absent

#### Scenario: Header actions follow the fixed order

- **WHEN** the detail header renders for a user with every permission
- **THEN** the actions appear in the order Manage access, Delete table, Add (or Save when not `ACTIVE`)

### Requirement: Table detail row writes

The Table detail page SHALL let the user write rows by entering a JSON array of row objects in a popup editor, opened via the header **Add** dropdown's **Add rows** item. Opening the editor SHALL prefill it with a one-row JSON template whose keys are the table's declared columns' **physical source names** (not their exposed names, which the backend's row-insert endpoint does not accept), each mapped to a value matching that column's type (`0` for Integer/Long/Decimal, `false` for Boolean, `{}` for Object, `[]` for Array, `""` otherwise) rather than a bare empty array, so the example stays valid input for every column. For an **enrichment** table the template SHALL additionally include the grain key as a top-level field, since the backend requires it on every inserted row. The **Insert rows** submit action SHALL be disabled while the editor's content does not parse as a JSON array, re-enabling as soon as it does; submitting invalid or non-array input SHALL additionally surface an error and SHALL NOT issue a request. Valid rows SHALL be posted via `addRows`, with a success or error notification.

#### Scenario: Opening Add rows prefills a type-shaped template

- **WHEN** the user opens the Add rows editor for a table with declared columns
- **THEN** the editor is prefilled with one row object keyed by each column's physical source name, with type-appropriate placeholder values

#### Scenario: Add rows template keys a renamed column by its source name

- **WHEN** a column's exposed name differs from its physical source name and the user opens Add rows
- **THEN** the template key for that column is its source name, not its exposed name

#### Scenario: Enrichment template includes the grain key

- **WHEN** the user opens the Add rows editor for an enrichment table
- **THEN** the template includes the grain key as a top-level field alongside the declared columns

#### Scenario: Insert rows is disabled while the JSON is invalid

- **WHEN** the editor's content is not valid JSON, or is valid JSON that is not an array
- **THEN** the Insert rows action is disabled
- **AND** it re-enables once the content becomes a valid JSON array

#### Scenario: Valid rows are inserted

- **WHEN** the user enters a valid JSON array of objects and submits
- **THEN** the rows are posted to the table and a success notification is shown

#### Scenario: Invalid rows JSON is rejected

- **WHEN** the user enters text that is not a JSON array
- **THEN** an error is shown and no request is issued

### Requirement: Delete confirmation identifies the table by name

Every delete-table confirmation dialog — the catalog list's row delete action and the detail view's **Delete table** action — SHALL show the target table's name as its own labeled row in the dialog, in addition to the standard warning copy, so the two surfaces present identical confirmation content.

#### Scenario: Catalog delete confirmation shows the table name

- **WHEN** the user activates a catalog row's delete action
- **THEN** the confirmation dialog shows a Name row with that table's name

#### Scenario: Detail delete confirmation shows the table name

- **WHEN** the user activates the detail view's Delete table action
- **THEN** the confirmation dialog shows a Name row with that table's name, matching the catalog's confirmation content

### Requirement: Full-admin per-table role management panel

The table detail view SHALL provide a panel to view and manage the table's `write` / `modify` provider-role lists, backed by `AnalyticsDataApi.getTableAccess` / `replaceTableAccess` (`GET` / `PUT /v1/tables/{name}/access`) and a `TableAccess { write: string[]; modify: string[] }` model. Because the backend restricts `GET /access` to `FULL_ADMIN` and system tables carry no per-table roles to manage, the panel SHALL be shown only when `canManageRoles` (`FULL_ADMIN` and non-system); a save SHALL full-replace the lists via `replaceTableAccess`. Role names SHALL be picked as checkboxes from the DIAL Roles catalog (fetched via `RolesApi.getRolesList`, the same source other admin surfaces such as App Routes already use for role selection) rather than typed free text — each option's value is the `DialRole.name`, which is also the raw provider-role string the backend matches against; there is no separate role id. While the initial fetch (the table's current access and the roles catalog, requested together) is in flight the panel SHALL show a loading spinner in place of the role pickers. A failed access fetch and a failed roles-catalog fetch SHALL each surface their own error notification (the two requests can fail independently); Save SHALL stay disabled until the access fetch succeeds.

#### Scenario: Full admin edits the role lists

- **WHEN** a `FULL_ADMIN` opens the role panel, checks a role in the `write` list, and saves
- **THEN** `replaceTableAccess` is called with the full updated `{write, modify}` lists

#### Scenario: Panel hidden for non-admins

- **WHEN** the detail view renders for a user who is not `FULL_ADMIN`
- **THEN** the role-management panel is not shown

#### Scenario: Panel hidden for system tables even for a full admin

- **WHEN** a `FULL_ADMIN` opens a system table's detail view
- **THEN** the role-management panel is not shown

#### Scenario: Loading spinner while fetching

- **WHEN** the panel opens
- **THEN** a loading spinner is shown until both the table's current access and the roles catalog have been fetched

#### Scenario: Every catalog role is offered, not just the granted ones

- **WHEN** the roles catalog loads
- **THEN** each write/modify picker offers every catalog role as a checkbox, with already-granted roles checked

#### Scenario: Roles-catalog fetch failure is surfaced independently

- **WHEN** the roles catalog fails to load even though the table's current access loads successfully
- **THEN** an error notification distinct from the access-load-failure notification is shown

### Requirement: System-owned tables are read-only

The catalog and detail views SHALL reflect the table's server-provided `system` flag. System-owned tables are seeded server-side and reject every modifying request (`409 table_is_system`), so the UI SHALL NOT offer modify actions for them: in the catalog the row's delete action SHALL be hidden and a System indicator SHALL be shown; in the detail view the manage-access / delete-table / write-rows / add-columns actions and the per-column edit/drop actions and inline rename SHALL be suppressed, replaced by a read-only indicator. System tables SHALL remain fully viewable and navigable, including their column display names and descriptions.

#### Scenario: System table in the catalog

- **WHEN** the catalog lists a table whose `system` flag is true
- **THEN** the row shows a System indicator
- **AND** the row's delete action is not offered

#### Scenario: System table detail is read-only

- **WHEN** the user opens a system table's detail page
- **THEN** the manage-access, delete-table, write-rows, and add-columns actions are absent and a read-only indicator is shown
- **AND** the column grid offers no edit/drop actions and no inline editing
- **AND** the table, its columns, and their display names and descriptions remain viewable

### Requirement: Analytics table role capability model

The system SHALL expose, on `AppContext`, the capability inputs for Analytics tables: `isFullAdmin`
(true when authentication is disabled, or when `userInfo.roles` includes `FULL_ADMIN`), the existing
`isReadOnlyAdmin`, and `isEnableAuth`. The `AnalyticsTable` model SHALL carry an optional
`permissions: { write: boolean; modify: boolean }` object supplied by the data-access service. A hook
`useAnalyticsTablePermissions(table?)` (`src/hooks/`) SHALL derive:

- `canCreate` SHALL equal `isFullAdmin`.
- `canDelete` and `canManageRoles` SHALL equal `isFullAdmin && !table.system`.
- `canWrite` SHALL equal `table.permissions.write` when present, otherwise `!isEnableAuth`.
- `canModify` SHALL equal `table.permissions.modify` when present, otherwise `!isEnableAuth`.

#### Scenario: Full admin can act on a non-system table

- **WHEN** authentication is enabled, the user is `FULL_ADMIN`, and a non-system table reports
  `permissions {write:true, modify:true}`
- **THEN** `canCreate`, `canDelete`, `canManageRoles`, `canWrite`, and `canModify` are all `true`

#### Scenario: Per-table write without modify

- **WHEN** a table reports `permissions {write:true, modify:false}` and the user is not `FULL_ADMIN`
- **THEN** `canWrite` is `true`, `canModify` is `false`, and `canCreate`/`canDelete`/`canManageRoles`
  are `false`

#### Scenario: System table exposes no edits, even for a full admin

- **WHEN** a system table reports `permissions {write:false, modify:false}` (as the backend does for
  every caller) and the user is `FULL_ADMIN`
- **THEN** `canWrite`, `canModify`, `canDelete`, and `canManageRoles` are all `false`

#### Scenario: Missing permissions default safely

- **WHEN** a table omits `permissions` and authentication is enabled
- **THEN** `canWrite` and `canModify` are `false`; **AND WHEN** authentication is disabled they are
  `true`

### Requirement: Tables catalog gates catalog-level actions to full admins

The Tables catalog view (`components/Analytics/Tables/TablesView.tsx`) SHALL render the "Create source"
and "Create enrichment" buttons and the per-row Delete action only when the user is `FULL_ADMIN`
(`canCreate` / `canDelete`). The existing per-row rule keeping Delete unavailable for system tables
SHALL be preserved. Read paths (listing and opening tables) SHALL be unaffected.

#### Scenario: Full admin sees catalog actions

- **WHEN** the catalog renders for a `FULL_ADMIN`
- **THEN** both create buttons and the row Delete action are present

#### Scenario: Non-admin sees a read-only catalog

- **WHEN** the catalog renders for a user who is not `FULL_ADMIN` (auth enabled)
- **THEN** neither create button nor the row Delete action is rendered

### Requirement: Table lifecycle status badge

The UI SHALL surface a table's lifecycle `status` (`PENDING`, `ACTIVE`, `FAILED`) with a status badge that reuses the established admin sync-status badge approach (an enum→label and enum→color-token mapping rendered as an uppercase rounded pill, mirroring `Common/SyncCoreStatus/CoreSyncStatusBadge`). The badge SHALL render `PENDING` as "Draft", `ACTIVE` as "Active", and `FAILED` as "Failed", using the theme color tokens (warning / success / error respectively). The badge SHALL appear in the table detail header and in the catalog grid. The UI SHALL NOT poll for status — status changes only in response to the user's own schema-definition submission, and the badge reflects the last fetched definition.

#### Scenario: Detail header shows the status badge

- **WHEN** the table detail view renders
- **THEN** a status badge for the table's current `status` is shown next to the title

#### Scenario: An active table reads as Active

- **WHEN** a table's `status` is `ACTIVE`
- **THEN** its badge renders the "Active" (success) state

### Requirement: Define and materialize a table schema

For a not-yet-materialized table (`status` `PENDING` or `FAILED`), the table detail view SHALL present a schema-definition surface in place of the live column surface. The surface SHALL let the user define the whole physical schema: for a **source**, a repeatable set of columns (a single **Name** field, used as both the column's exposed name and its physical source name since the two are always equal at definition time, type, nullable, optional tag, optional sensitive flag, and — for a column typed Array — a required element type), an ordering key chosen from the declared column names, and an optional partition (a temporal column + a day/month/year granularity); for an **enrichment**, its columns plus a grain key chosen from its source table's columns. Cardinality SHALL NOT be user-selectable — the enrichment submission SHALL send the single supported value (`zero_or_one`). Column rows SHALL be validated for identifier grammar, uniqueness, and tag length exactly as the create/add-columns editor validates today, against both the exposed-name and source-name uniqueness constraints (which the merged Name field satisfies identically).

An Array-typed column row SHALL offer an additional element-type selector, restricted to the non-array, non-object column types (no nested arrays or objects). Submitting a row typed Array without an element type SHALL be rejected client-side (the backend also rejects it, 422). An Array-typed row's Nullable control SHALL be disabled and forced off — the backend rejects a nullable array column.

For a **source** table, the Partition column field's label SHALL carry an info affordance (an icon with a hover tooltip) explaining that only Date/Timestamp-typed columns are selectable, since that restriction is not otherwise visually obvious. The Granularity field SHALL be rendered only once a partition column is selected; deselecting the partition column (including indirectly, by retyping the selected column away from Date/Timestamp) SHALL also clear any chosen granularity.

Submitting the schema (a header **Save** action) SHALL send the whole document via `defineTableSchema` (`POST /v1/tables/{name}/schema`), which defines the schema **and** materializes the table in the same call — there is no separate save-draft step, and no way to persist an incomplete schema. Save SHALL be disabled until the schema is complete for its kind (a source needs at least one valid column and a non-empty ordering key; an enrichment needs a grain key), since the backend rejects an incomplete submission (422) without persisting it. On success the view SHALL refresh showing the table `ACTIVE` with its live column surface. On a backend (ClickHouse) failure the table becomes `FAILED`; the detail view SHALL present the same schema-definition surface with an indication that activation failed, allowing the user to adjust the schema and resubmit. While the table is not `ACTIVE`, the write-rows action SHALL NOT be offered.

#### Scenario: Save is gated on a complete schema

- **WHEN** a source table's schema has no ordering key (or no columns), or an enrichment's schema has no grain key
- **THEN** the Save action is disabled
- **AND** once the schema is complete the Save action is enabled

#### Scenario: Save defines and activates the table

- **WHEN** the user submits a `PENDING` table's complete schema and the request succeeds
- **THEN** `defineTableSchema` is sent and the view refreshes showing the table as `ACTIVE` with its live column surface

#### Scenario: Failed activation can be retried

- **WHEN** a table is `FAILED`
- **THEN** the detail view shows the schema-definition surface with a failure indication
- **AND** the user can adjust the schema and submit again

#### Scenario: Enrichment schema hardcodes cardinality

- **WHEN** an enrichment schema is submitted
- **THEN** the payload carries cardinality `zero_or_one` and no cardinality control is rendered

#### Scenario: Array column requires an element type

- **WHEN** the user sets a column row's type to Array and leaves its element type unset
- **THEN** the row shows a validation error and Save is disabled
- **AND** choosing an element type (a non-array, non-object type) clears the error

#### Scenario: Array column cannot be nullable

- **WHEN** a column row's type is Array
- **THEN** its Nullable control is disabled and shows off
- **AND** the built column payload does not send `nullable: true` for that row

#### Scenario: Partition column restriction is explained via a tooltip

- **WHEN** a source table's schema-definition surface renders
- **THEN** the Partition column field's label shows an info icon
- **AND** hovering it shows a tooltip explaining that only Date/Timestamp columns are selectable

#### Scenario: Granularity is hidden until a partition column is chosen

- **WHEN** no partition column is selected
- **THEN** the Granularity field is not rendered
- **AND** selecting a partition column reveals it

#### Scenario: Retyping the selected partition column clears granularity too

- **WHEN** the column currently selected as the partition column is retyped away from Date/Timestamp
- **THEN** the partition column selection is cleared
- **AND** the previously chosen granularity is cleared, and the Granularity field is hidden again

### Requirement: Table metadata editing (description and tag order)

The **catalog list's** row action menu SHALL let the user edit a table's catalog metadata — its `description` and its per-table `tag_order` — in any status, via `updateTable` (`PUT /v1/tables/{name}`). `tag_order` SHALL be presented as a reorderable list of the distinct tags currently declared on the table's columns, and the resulting ordered list of tag names SHALL be sent to the backend; an empty order SHALL clear it and an unchanged order SHALL be left as-is (merge-patch semantics). On success the catalog SHALL refresh from the server. This surface SHALL NOT be offered for system-owned tables, and SHALL NOT be offered from the table detail view.

#### Scenario: Description is edited via the table update endpoint

- **WHEN** the user activates a row's edit action, changes the table description, and submits
- **THEN** `updateTable` is sent with the new description and the catalog refreshes

#### Scenario: Tag order is reordered and saved

- **WHEN** the user reorders the table's column tags and submits
- **THEN** `updateTable` is sent with the ordered `tag_order` list and the catalog refreshes

### Requirement: Query Assistant feature flag derives from deployment config

The system SHALL expose a `queryAssistantEnabled: boolean` on the `FeatureFlags` object
(`models/feature-flags.ts`), initialized in the root layout (`app/[lang]/layout.tsx`) alongside the
other flags. It SHALL be `true` only when `ANALYTICS_ENABLED` resolves truthy (per `isValueTruthy`)
AND `process.env.DIAL_QUERY_ASSISTANT_DEPLOYMENT` is present (non-empty); otherwise `false`. The
`DIAL_QUERY_ASSISTANT_DEPLOYMENT` value is the assistant application's DIAL Core deployment id
(resource URL, stored raw with literal `/`) and SHALL be read server-side only.

#### Scenario: Flag true when analytics enabled and deployment set

- **WHEN** `ANALYTICS_ENABLED` is truthy and `DIAL_QUERY_ASSISTANT_DEPLOYMENT` is set to a non-empty value
- **THEN** `featureFlags.queryAssistantEnabled` is `true`

#### Scenario: Flag false when deployment unset

- **WHEN** `ANALYTICS_ENABLED` is truthy but `DIAL_QUERY_ASSISTANT_DEPLOYMENT` is unset or empty
- **THEN** `featureFlags.queryAssistantEnabled` is `false`

#### Scenario: Flag false when analytics disabled

- **WHEN** `ANALYTICS_ENABLED` is falsy
- **THEN** `featureFlags.queryAssistantEnabled` is `false` regardless of the deployment variable

### Requirement: Query Builder rail offers an AI view when the assistant is enabled

The Query Builder view switcher SHALL include a fourth mutually exclusive view — AI — alongside Form,
JSON, and SQL, rendered in the existing segmented control and marked with a spark icon. The AI option
SHALL be present only when `featureFlags.queryAssistantEnabled` is `true`. When the flag is `false` the
switcher SHALL offer exactly the existing three views. As with the other views, the switcher (and thus
the AI option) is available only once an entity schema has loaded.

#### Scenario: AI option shown when enabled

- **WHEN** the schema has loaded and `queryAssistantEnabled` is `true`
- **THEN** the view switcher offers Form, JSON, SQL, and AI

#### Scenario: AI option hidden when disabled

- **WHEN** the schema has loaded and `queryAssistantEnabled` is `false`
- **THEN** the view switcher offers only Form, JSON, and SQL and no AI option is present

#### Scenario: Selecting the AI view

- **WHEN** the user selects the AI view
- **THEN** the rail shows the AI panel and the current view is indicated as AI

### Requirement: AI panel accepts a plain-language prompt with suggestions

In the AI view the rail SHALL render a heading, an explanatory description, a conversation transcript,
a multi-line text input for a plain-language request, and a Send action. While the transcript is empty
the rail SHALL additionally render a set of suggested-prompt chips; once at least one message has been
sent the chips SHALL no longer be shown. Clicking a suggested-prompt chip SHALL populate the text input
with that chip's prompt text. The Send action SHALL be disabled while the input is empty or a
generation request is in flight. All text SHALL be provided through i18n.

#### Scenario: Suggested prompt fills the input

- **WHEN** the AI view is shown, the transcript is empty, and the user clicks a suggested-prompt chip
- **THEN** the text input is populated with that chip's prompt text

#### Scenario: Suggestions hidden once a conversation has started

- **WHEN** at least one message has been sent in the AI view
- **THEN** the suggested-prompt chips are no longer shown

#### Scenario: Send disabled when input empty

- **WHEN** the text input is empty
- **THEN** the Send action is disabled

#### Scenario: Send disabled while in flight

- **WHEN** a generation request is in progress
- **THEN** the Send action is disabled and a loading indicator is shown

### Requirement: Generate calls the assistant and shows the proposed query

Activating Send SHALL append the user's request as a new message in the visible transcript and call
the `generateQuery` server action with the full accumulated `messages[]`, which posts to the configured
deployment's chat-completions endpoint on DIAL Core (`QueryAssistantApi`, reusing `DIAL_CORE_API_URL`
and Bearer auth). On success the assistant's reply SHALL be appended as a new message in the
transcript, rendered as-is (no SQL extraction applied to the rendered text). When the reply contains an
extractable SQL block, that message additionally renders the extracted SQL read-only with its own Copy
and Run actions (see "Each assistant message with extracted SQL offers inline Run and Copy"). On
failure the system SHALL surface an error notification (header, message, and request id when
available); the just-sent user message SHALL remain visible in the transcript and no assistant message
SHALL be appended, so the user can retry or continue the conversation without losing what they asked.

#### Scenario: Successful generation appends to the transcript

- **WHEN** the user submits a request and the assistant returns a reply
- **THEN** the user's request and the assistant's reply both appear as new messages in the transcript

#### Scenario: Reply without SQL is a plain conversational turn

- **WHEN** the assistant reply contains no SQL block
- **THEN** the assistant's message is shown in the transcript with no Run or Copy action, and any
  previously loaded query is left untouched

#### Scenario: Generation failure notifies and preserves the transcript

- **WHEN** the `generateQuery` action returns a failure
- **THEN** an error notification is shown, the user's just-sent message remains in the transcript, and
  no assistant message is appended

### Requirement: SQL is extracted from the assistant reply

The system SHALL provide a pure `extractSql(content)` utility that returns the trimmed contents of the
last fenced code block tagged `sql` (case-insensitive) in a single message's content. If no
`sql`-tagged block exists but an untagged fenced block does, that block SHALL be returned as a
fallback. If no fenced block exists, the utility SHALL return `null`. The utility SHALL be unit-tested.
It SHALL be applied independently to each assistant message in the conversation, so a conversation with
several assistant turns can have several messages each carrying their own extracted SQL (or none).

#### Scenario: Extract the sql-tagged block

- **WHEN** a message's content contains prose and a ` ```sql … ``` ` block
- **THEN** `extractSql` returns the block's SQL text, trimmed, without the fences

#### Scenario: Last block wins within a message

- **WHEN** a single message's content contains more than one fenced SQL block
- **THEN** `extractSql` returns the contents of that message's last block

#### Scenario: No block returns null

- **WHEN** a message's content contains no fenced code block
- **THEN** `extractSql` returns `null` for that message

#### Scenario: Extraction is independent per message

- **WHEN** a conversation has multiple assistant messages, some with SQL blocks and some without
- **THEN** each message's extraction result reflects only that message's own content

### Requirement: Each assistant message with extracted SQL offers inline Run and Copy

An assistant message whose content yields a non-null result from `extractSql` SHALL render that SQL
read-only beneath the message, with its own Copy action and its own Run action. A message with no
extracted SQL SHALL render neither action. The Run action SHALL be disabled while any message's Run is
already in progress (translating or executing), and SHALL also be disabled on the message that is
currently the loaded query (see "Running a message's query loads it into the builder and executes it")
— that disabled state is the only indicator of which message is current; there is no separate badge.

#### Scenario: SQL-bearing message shows Run and Copy

- **WHEN** an assistant message has extracted SQL
- **THEN** that message renders the SQL read-only with a Copy action and a Run action

#### Scenario: Plain message shows neither action

- **WHEN** an assistant message has no extracted SQL
- **THEN** that message renders no Copy action and no Run action

#### Scenario: Run disabled while another run is in progress

- **WHEN** a message's Run has been clicked and its translate-and-execute is still in flight
- **THEN** every message's Run action in the transcript is disabled until it completes

#### Scenario: Run disabled on the currently loaded message

- **WHEN** a message's query is the currently loaded query
- **THEN** that message's Run action is disabled, while other SQL-bearing messages' Run actions remain
  enabled

### Requirement: Running a message's query loads it into the builder and executes it

Clicking a message's Run action SHALL translate that message's SQL into a structured query and, when
the builder can represent it, hydrate the builder state so the Builder, JSON, and SQL views all reflect
it; when the query cannot be represented (or translation fails), the raw SQL SHALL remain runnable and
visible in the SQL view instead. In the same action, the system SHALL execute the query (via the
structured or SQL execution path, matching whichever form was loaded) and show the result in the
existing result area. The AI view SHALL remain active after Run (no forced view switch). The message
whose Run was most recently clicked SHALL have its Run action disabled to indicate it is the currently
loaded query (see "Each assistant message with extracted SQL offers inline Run and Copy") — no separate
visual badge is used.

#### Scenario: Representable query loads and runs

- **WHEN** the user clicks Run on a message whose query the builder can represent
- **THEN** the Builder, JSON, and SQL views are hydrated with that query, the query executes, and the
  result appears in the result area

#### Scenario: Non-representable query still runs via SQL

- **WHEN** the user clicks Run on a message whose query the builder cannot represent (or translation
  fails)
- **THEN** the raw SQL remains visible and runnable in the SQL view, and the query still executes via
  the SQL path

#### Scenario: Running an earlier message updates which query is loaded

- **WHEN** a later message's Run was previously clicked and the user then clicks an earlier message's
  Run
- **THEN** the earlier message's Run action becomes disabled, the later message's Run action becomes
  enabled again, and the Builder/JSON/SQL views and any subsequent toolbar-independent Copy reflect the
  earlier query instead

#### Scenario: Changing the entity clears the conversation and loaded state

- **WHEN** a query has been run from the AI view and the user selects a different entity
- **THEN** the conversation is cleared entirely (no messages remain, so no Run action is disabled or
  present)

### Requirement: Toolbar Run and Copy are not shown in the AI view

When the AI view is active, the Query Builder toolbar SHALL NOT render its Run action or its Copy
action; the entity selector and time filter controls remain. Running and copying a query in the AI view
happens only through the per-message actions on the transcript.

#### Scenario: Toolbar Run hidden in AI view

- **WHEN** the AI view is active
- **THEN** the toolbar does not show a Run action

#### Scenario: Toolbar Copy hidden in AI view

- **WHEN** the AI view is active
- **THEN** the toolbar does not show a Copy action

#### Scenario: Entity and time controls remain available

- **WHEN** the AI view is active
- **THEN** the entity selector and time filter controls are still shown and usable
