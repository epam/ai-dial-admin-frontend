# Analytics — Master Spec

## Purpose

Analytics is an experimental admin capability, gated by the `ANALYTICS_ENABLED` environment
variable, that lets an operator explore and shape analytics data held by the Analytics data-access
service (`analytics-data-access-service`, hosted at `DIAL_ANALYTICS_API_URL`). It surfaces as a
"Analytics" left-navigation group (carrying a "Preview" tag) with two pages:

- **Query Builder** — a results-first workbench: assemble a `StructuredQuery` through form controls,
  edit it as JSON, or write ad-hoc SQL in a collapsible right-side rail (Builder, JSON, and SQL are
  three views of the rail), then run it and read the result — table or chart — in the main area.
- **Tables** — a catalog of source/enrichment tables with a detail page for managing each table's
  column schema and writing rows; system-owned tables are read-only.

All transport goes through a single server-side client (`AnalyticsDataApi`) via server actions; pages
prefetch their initial data on the server and hand it to client views.

This folder (`openspec/specs/analytics/`) is the single home for all Analytics specs; this file is
the consolidated master spec, folding in the scaffold, Query Builder, SQL editor, and Tables stories.

## Requirements

### Requirement: ANALYTICS_ENABLED feature flag is surfaced on FeatureFlags

The system SHALL expose an environment variable `ANALYTICS_ENABLED` whose value is surfaced at runtime on the `FeatureFlags` object as `analyticsEnabled: boolean`. The flag MUST be `true` only when `process.env.ANALYTICS_ENABLED` is present and resolves truthy per the existing `isValueTruthy` helper; otherwise it MUST be `false`. The flag SHALL be initialized in the root layout (`app/[lang]/layout.tsx`) alongside the other feature flags and added to the `FeatureFlags` model (`models/feature-flags.ts`).

#### Scenario: Flag is true when env var is explicitly truthy

- **WHEN** `process.env.ANALYTICS_ENABLED` is set to `'true'` and the root layout initializes `FeatureFlags`
- **THEN** `featureFlags.analyticsEnabled` is `true`

#### Scenario: Flag defaults to false when env var is unset

- **WHEN** `process.env.ANALYTICS_ENABLED` is not set
- **THEN** `featureFlags.analyticsEnabled` is `false`

#### Scenario: Flag is false when env var is falsy

- **WHEN** `process.env.ANALYTICS_ENABLED` is set to `'false'`, `''`, `'0'`, or any value that `isValueTruthy` treats as falsy
- **THEN** `featureFlags.analyticsEnabled` is `false`

### Requirement: Analytics menu group with Query Builder and Tables sub-items

The left-navigation menu configuration (`MENU_CONFIGURATION` in `menu-configuration.tsx`) SHALL define an "Analytics" menu group whose sub-items are, in order, "Query Builder" (linking to the Query Builder route) and "Tables" (linking to the Tables route). The group MUST use its own icon and follow the existing `MenuGroupConfiguration` shape. Routes SHALL be present in the `ApplicationRoute` enum (`types/routes.ts`) — `/query-builder` and `/tables` — and labels SHALL exist in `MenuI18nKey` (`constants/i18n.ts`) with English strings in `locales/en.ts` ("Analytics", "Query Builder", "Tables").

#### Scenario: Group and sub-items render when flag enabled

- **WHEN** `featureFlags.analyticsEnabled` is `true` and the sidebar menu renders
- **THEN** an "Analytics" group is present
- **AND** expanding it shows a "Query Builder" sub-item linking to `/query-builder`
- **AND** it shows a "Tables" sub-item linking to `/tables`

### Requirement: Analytics menu group is gated by the feature flag

The "Analytics" group SHALL be present in the menu only when `featureFlags.analyticsEnabled` is `true`, following the same filtering pattern used for the Deployments and Evaluation groups in `MENU_CONFIGURATION`. When the flag is `false`, the entire group and both sub-items MUST be absent from the sidebar, and the group's gating MUST compose independently of every other flag-gated group (disabling or enabling any other group MUST NOT affect Analytics's visibility, and vice versa).

#### Scenario: Group hidden when flag disabled

- **WHEN** `featureFlags.analyticsEnabled` is `false` and the sidebar menu renders
- **THEN** the "Analytics" group and both its sub-items are absent from the sidebar

#### Scenario: Gating composes independently of other groups

- **WHEN** `featureFlags.analyticsEnabled` is `true` while `featureFlags.deploymentsEnabled` and `featureFlags.evaluationEnabled` are `false`
- **THEN** the "Analytics" group is present
- **AND** the Deployments and Evaluation groups are absent

### Requirement: Preview tag on the Analytics group header

The "Analytics" menu group header SHALL display the existing `PreviewTag` component. Because the preview-tag mechanism (`PREVIEW_TAG_MENU_ITEMS` in `MenuItemContent.tsx`) applies only to sub-items, the group header component (`MenuItem.tsx`) SHALL render a `PreviewTag` for groups marked as preview (an opt-in field on `MenuGroupConfiguration`). The tag MUST render only when the sidebar is expanded, and MUST NOT appear on any other group header. Sub-items ("Query Builder", "Tables") MUST NOT each carry their own preview tag.

#### Scenario: Preview tag shown on expanded group header

- **WHEN** the sidebar is expanded and the "Analytics" group is rendered
- **THEN** a "Preview" tag is shown on the "Analytics" group header
- **AND** no other group header shows a "Preview" tag

#### Scenario: Preview tag hidden when sidebar collapsed

- **WHEN** the sidebar is collapsed
- **THEN** the "Preview" tag is not rendered on the group header

### Requirement: Analytics data-access server API layer is configured

The server-side API layer SHALL provide a single typed client, `AnalyticsDataApi`, for the Analytics data-access service, hosted at `process.env.DIAL_ANALYTICS_API_URL`. The client instance SHALL be created and exported once from `app/api/api.ts` as `analyticsDataApi` (following the existing per-service instantiation pattern); the class SHALL extend `BaseApi` and live at `src/server/analytics/analytics-data-api.ts`. Request/response DTOs SHALL be placed in dedicated model files under `src/models/analytics/`. All requests SHALL send the standard auth/API headers via the existing helpers, and `{name}` path segments MUST be URL-encoded.

Queries endpoints (base path `/v1/queries`):
- `GET /v1/queries/entities` — list queryable entities
- `GET /v1/queries/entities/schema/{name}` — fetch the field schema for a named entity
- `POST /v1/queries/execute` — execute a structured query; exposed as `executeAction`, returning a `ServerActionResponse` so callers can surface an error header/message on failure
- `POST /v1/queries/execute-sql` — execute an ad-hoc SQL SELECT (body `{ sql }`); exposed as `executeSqlAction`, returning a `ServerActionResponse` with the same result envelope as `execute`

Tables endpoints (base path `/v1/tables`):
- `GET /v1/tables` — list tables; the response is wrapped as `{ tables: [...] }` and the client SHALL unwrap it to a bare array
- `POST /v1/tables` — create a table or enrichment (body-discriminated)
- `GET /v1/tables/{name}` — read one table by name
- `DELETE /v1/tables/{name}` — delete a table by name
- `PATCH /v1/tables/{name}/schema` — update a table's schema
- `POST /v1/tables/{name}/rows` — insert rows into a table

#### Scenario: Client targets the Analytics data-access host

- **WHEN** `analyticsDataApi` is instantiated in `app/api/api.ts`
- **THEN** it is constructed with `host: process.env.DIAL_ANALYTICS_API_URL`

#### Scenario: Client covers the queries endpoints

- **WHEN** `analyticsDataApi` is used
- **THEN** it can issue `GET /v1/queries/entities`, `GET /v1/queries/entities/schema/{name}`, `POST /v1/queries/execute` via `executeAction`, and `POST /v1/queries/execute-sql` via `executeSqlAction`

#### Scenario: Client covers the tables endpoints

- **WHEN** `analyticsDataApi` is used
- **THEN** it can issue `GET /v1/tables` (unwrapping `{ tables }`), `POST /v1/tables`, `GET /v1/tables/{name}`, `DELETE /v1/tables/{name}`, `PATCH /v1/tables/{name}/schema`, and `POST /v1/tables/{name}/rows`

### Requirement: Analytics pages fetch initial data server-side

The Analytics pages SHALL be `async` server components (`export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`) that fetch their initial data on the server via server actions delegating to `analyticsDataApi`, and pass that data to a client view as props; the client view SHALL own all subsequent interactive state and re-fetching. Fetch failures SHALL be logged (`errorObjLog`); a page whose required single entity is missing SHALL call `notFound()`. Pages SHALL NOT fetch their initial data from a client-side effect.

#### Scenario: Tables catalog data is fetched on the server

- **WHEN** the user navigates to `/tables`
- **THEN** the page awaits the tables list on the server and renders the catalog view seeded with it
- **AND** if the list request fails the page resolves to a not-found result

#### Scenario: Table detail data is fetched on the server

- **WHEN** the user navigates to `/tables/{name}`
- **THEN** the page awaits that table on the server and renders the detail view seeded with it
- **AND** if the table is missing the page resolves to a not-found result

### Requirement: Query Builder layout and view switcher

The Query Builder page (`app/[lang]/query-builder/page.tsx`) SHALL render a page title, a toolbar, a main results area, and a query-builder rail on the right side of the content area. The toolbar SHALL contain the source (entity) selector, the shared time filter, and the Run action. The rail header SHALL offer three mutually exclusive views — **Builder** (form), **SQL**, and **JSON** — via a `DialSegmentedControl`; selecting a view SHALL change the rail body without a page reload and the current view SHALL be indicated. The view switcher SHALL NOT be shown before a schema is loaded. Base form controls SHALL come from the DIAL UI Kit and tabular results SHALL be displayed with the app's grid stack.

#### Scenario: Results-first layout renders

- **WHEN** the user opens `/query-builder`
- **THEN** a toolbar with source selector, time filter, and Run is shown
- **AND** the results area is the main content
- **AND** the query-builder rail is shown at the right

#### Scenario: Three views offered once a schema is loaded

- **WHEN** the page has loaded an entity schema
- **THEN** the rail header offers Builder, SQL, and JSON views
- **AND** one view is indicated as selected

#### Scenario: Switcher hidden before a schema loads

- **WHEN** no schema has been loaded yet
- **THEN** the view switcher is not shown

### Requirement: Query Builder initial data loading and state

The Query Builder page SHALL prefetch the queryable entities on the server and the first entity's schema, passing `initialEntities`, `initialEntityName`, and `initialFields` to the client builder. The client SHALL seed its `QueryBuilderState` (entity name + fields, with default mode/filter/select/sort/page) from those props without a mount-time fetch. The toolbar SHALL show the entity selector. Changing the selected entity SHALL load its schema client-side via the `getEntitySchema` server action and reset builder selections that may reference stale fields. When no entities were provided, the builder SHALL show the entities-load-failed empty state.

#### Scenario: Builder is seeded from server-fetched props

- **WHEN** the page prefetched a non-empty entities list and the first entity's schema
- **THEN** the builder renders with that entity selected and its fields available
- **AND** no client-side entities/schema request is issued on mount

#### Scenario: Changing entity reloads schema and resets selections

- **WHEN** the user selects a different (simple) entity
- **THEN** its schema is loaded client-side
- **AND** builder selections that referenced the previous schema's fields are cleared

#### Scenario: No entities provided

- **WHEN** the page provides an empty entities list
- **THEN** the builder shows the entities-load-failed empty state and no builder sections

### Requirement: Query Builder toolbar

The Query Builder page SHALL render an in-page toolbar containing, left to right: the source (entity) selector as a plain dropdown (`DialSelectField`, no schema-preview affordance), the shared time filter (`TimeFilter` with the global preset options and a custom-range picker), and the Run primary action aligned to the right.

#### Scenario: Toolbar composition

- **WHEN** the user opens the page with entities loaded
- **THEN** the toolbar shows the source dropdown, the time filter, and the Run action

### Requirement: Time range is part of the structured query

The toolbar time filter SHALL be a query control: its resolved range SHALL serialize into the structured query's filter as `ge`/`le` predicates on the source's automatically detected timestamp field (the first temporal-typed field of the loaded schema). The serialized query — as shown in the JSON view, copied by the Copy action, and executed by Run — SHALL include these predicates; nothing is added invisibly at execution time. The time predicates SHALL NOT be shown in the visual Filters tree — the toolbar control is their editor. When parsing JSON back into builder state, a matching `ge` + `le` predicate pair on the timestamp field SHALL be lifted into the toolbar control (displayed as a custom range); time conditions in any other shape or on other fields SHALL remain ordinary filter conditions. When the schema has no temporal field, no time predicates SHALL be serialized and the query runs without a time bound. SQL text SHALL never be modified by the time filter.

#### Scenario: Time range serializes into the query

- **WHEN** the user has a time range selected and the schema has a temporal field
- **THEN** the serialized query's filter includes `ge` and `le` predicates on that field for the resolved range
- **AND** the JSON view displays these predicates
- **AND** the visual Filters tree does not display them

#### Scenario: JSON time predicates round-trip into the toolbar control

- **WHEN** the user edits the JSON's `ge`/`le` predicate pair on the timestamp field to a different range and the JSON is otherwise representable
- **THEN** the toolbar time filter reflects the edited range as a custom range
- **AND** the predicates do not appear in the visual Filters tree

#### Scenario: No temporal field

- **WHEN** the loaded schema has no temporal-typed field
- **THEN** the serialized query contains no time predicates and the run is not time-bounded

#### Scenario: SQL runs are not modified

- **WHEN** the user runs a query from the SQL view
- **THEN** the executed SQL is exactly the editor text

### Requirement: Query builder rail with collapse

The query builder SHALL render in a fixed-width rail at the right edge of the content area with a header containing a collapse control and the view switcher. Collapsing SHALL hide the rail entirely and show a restore ("Query builder") button in the results-area header; restoring SHALL bring the rail back. The collapsed state SHALL be persisted in the browser's local storage under a Query-Builder-specific key and applied SSR-safely on the next visit.

#### Scenario: Collapse frees the results area

- **WHEN** the user activates the rail collapse control
- **THEN** the rail is hidden and the results area takes the full content width
- **AND** a restore button appears in the results-area header

#### Scenario: Restore brings the rail back

- **WHEN** the rail is collapsed and the user activates the restore button
- **THEN** the rail is shown again with its previous view and state

#### Scenario: Collapsed state persists

- **WHEN** the user collapses the rail and reloads the page
- **THEN** the rail is initially collapsed

### Requirement: Builder sections use section blocks with categorized field dropdowns and collapsible items

<!-- Merged from add-column-labels-and-descriptions (archived): display names, descriptions, and the bounded-width dropdown with hover tooltips. -->

Each Builder-view section (Group by, Aggregates, Select, Filters, Having, Sort, Page) SHALL render as a bordered section block with a labeled header and a header-level add action where applicable. Field pickers SHALL be searchable dropdowns whose options are grouped by the field's schema tag/category (untagged fields under a default group). Category groups SHALL be collapsible headers showing the group's option count, with at most one category expanded at a time (accordion); the group holding the current selection SHALL start expanded, and an active search term SHALL show all matches regardless of collapse state. Category header colors SHALL cycle the full builder palette. The dropdown's search input SHALL use the same compact boxed style as the builder's other controls.

Field options SHALL display the field's **display name** — the schema `display_name` when set, otherwise the field `name` — as primary text, the field type right-aligned, and the schema `description` as a secondary line when present; fields without display name and description SHALL render as a single line. The dropdown overlay width SHALL stay bounded: long descriptions truncate to one line and the full text is reachable via a hover tooltip of reasonable width. The dropdown search SHALL match against both the field name and its display name. Added items SHALL render compactly — chips for plain fields, collapsible rows for parameterized items (group-by functions, aggregates, conditions, having rows, sort keys) that expand into their editor and collapse back to a summary chip tinted with the owning section's palette color — and chips and collapsed summaries SHALL refer to fields by their display name. Display names are presentation-only: structured-query serialization, the JSON view, and the SQL view SHALL always use the raw field `name`. Styling SHALL use the project's palette/theme tokens only.

#### Scenario: Field dropdown groups by category

- **WHEN** the user opens a field dropdown in a builder section
- **THEN** the fields are grouped under collapsible category headers with option counts
- **AND** expanding one category collapses the previously expanded one
- **AND** typing in the search shows all matching fields across categories

#### Scenario: Display-named field renders display name, description, and type

- **WHEN** the schema field `total_money` carries display name "Total money spend" and a description
- **THEN** its dropdown option shows "Total money spend" as primary text with the type right-aligned
- **AND** the description is shown as a secondary line

#### Scenario: Field without a display name falls back to its name

- **WHEN** a schema field has no display name and no description
- **THEN** its dropdown option shows the raw field name in a single line, as before

#### Scenario: Search matches the display name

- **WHEN** the user types "money" and only the field `total_money` with display name "Total money spend" matches
- **THEN** that field is shown in the results
- **AND** searching by the raw name `total_money` finds it as well

#### Scenario: Chips and summaries use the display name

- **WHEN** the user adds a projection chip and an aggregate over a field with a display name
- **THEN** the chip shows the field's display name
- **AND** the collapsed aggregate summary refers to the field by its display name
- **AND** the serialized query and the JSON view reference the raw field name

#### Scenario: Parameterized item collapses to a summary

- **WHEN** the user collapses an aggregate or filter-condition row
- **THEN** the row shows a compact summary of its configuration in its section's color
- **AND** expanding it restores the full editor

### Requirement: Query mode and DISTINCT

In the Builder view the rail SHALL let the user choose the query mode — `row` (projection) or `aggregate` (group + metrics) — via a two-option `DialSegmentedControl` at the top of the view. Selecting `row` SHALL show the projection (Select) section and hide the aggregate sections; selecting `aggregate` SHALL show the Group by, Aggregate, and Having sections and hide the projection section. DISTINCT controls SHALL NOT be rendered (neither a query-level toggle nor per-aggregate checkboxes); the serializer's support for `distinct` remains for JSON-authored queries.

#### Scenario: Switching to aggregate mode swaps sections

- **WHEN** the user selects `aggregate` mode
- **THEN** the Group by, Aggregate, and Having sections are shown
- **AND** the projection (Select) section is hidden

#### Scenario: DISTINCT is not offered

- **WHEN** the user inspects the Builder view in either mode
- **THEN** no DISTINCT toggle or checkbox is present

### Requirement: Filter (WHERE) builder with nested groups

The Filter section SHALL let the user build a WHERE tree limited to two levels: the root group holds conditions and groups, and nested groups hold only conditions. The "add nested group" action SHALL be offered only at the root group; nested groups SHALL offer only add-condition and remove actions. Each group SHALL expose a logical operator selector (AND / OR / NOT). Each condition SHALL expose a field selector (from the loaded schema, grouped by field category), an operator selector (`eq`, `ne`, `co`, `nc`, `lt`, `gt`, `le`, `ge`, `in`), a value input, a value-type selector, and a remove action. For `eq`/`ne` the condition SHALL offer an "is null" option that, when set, serializes the right operand as a null value (`value_type: null`) and hides the value input. For `in` the value SHALL be entered as comma-separated tokens and serialize to an array expression of value expressions (empty tokens dropped). Empty groups and fieldless conditions SHALL be omitted; a `not` group SHALL wrap its single child, or an `and` of its children. Deeper nesting SHALL be expressible only through the SQL view.

#### Scenario: Nested group with a condition serializes

- **WHEN** the root group is AND with one condition `field eq value` and one nested OR group
- **THEN** the serialized `filter` has `op: "and"` whose args include the predicate and the nested `op: "or"` group
- **AND** groups with no conditions are omitted

#### Scenario: Nested groups cannot nest further

- **WHEN** the user inspects a nested (depth-1) group's actions
- **THEN** an add-condition action is offered
- **AND** no add-group action is offered

#### Scenario: is-null predicate

- **WHEN** a condition uses `eq` with "is null" enabled
- **THEN** the value input is hidden
- **AND** the predicate's right operand serializes as `{ "type": "value", "value_type": "null", "value": null }`

#### Scenario: in-operator builds an array

- **WHEN** a condition uses `in` with value `a, b, c`
- **THEN** the predicate's right operand serializes as an array expression with three value items

### Requirement: Row-mode projection

In `row` mode the Select section SHALL let the user add projection fields through a categorized searchable dropdown; added fields SHALL render as removable chips. Added fields SHALL serialize to `select` as field-expression output columns, in selection order. When no field is added, `select` SHALL be omitted (default projection).

#### Scenario: Selected fields become projection columns

- **WHEN** the user adds two fields in row mode
- **THEN** the serialized `select` contains a field-expression output column for each added field
- **AND** each added field is shown as a chip with a remove action

#### Scenario: No projection omits select

- **WHEN** no field is added in row mode
- **THEN** the serialized query has no `select` key

### Requirement: Aggregate-mode group by, time buckets, and metrics

In `aggregate` mode the builder SHALL provide a single Group by section combining plain columns and scalar-function entries, and an Aggregate section for metrics. The Group by add-dropdown SHALL offer the schema columns (categorized) plus a Functions group with the service's scalar allowlist: `date_bin`, `lower`, `upper`, `length`, `trim`, `abs`. Picking a column SHALL add it as a removable chip; picking a function SHALL add a parameterized row — `date_bin` with an amount, a unit (`second`, `minute`, `hour`, `day`, `week`), a source timestamp/date field, and an alias; every other function with a field and an alias. There SHALL be no separate Time bucket section. Aggregate metrics keep a function (`count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`), an optional field argument, and an alias. The serialized query SHALL place plain group-by field projections, aliased scalar-function columns, and aliased aggregate columns into `select`, and SHALL list plain group-by fields by name and function entries by alias in `group_by` (function entries without a field or alias are excluded from `group_by`).

#### Scenario: Aggregate select and group_by are built

- **WHEN** the user adds a group-by column and a `sum` aggregate over a field with alias `total`
- **THEN** `select` includes the group-by field column and a `sum` function column aliased `total`
- **AND** `group_by` includes the group-by field

#### Scenario: date_bin function entry becomes a bucket column

- **WHEN** the user picks `date_bin` from the Group by Functions group with 5 minutes over a timestamp field and alias `bucket`
- **THEN** `select` includes a `date_bin` function column aliased `bucket`
- **AND** `group_by` includes `bucket`

#### Scenario: Scalar function entry serializes with its alias

- **WHEN** the user picks `lower` over a string field with alias `dep`
- **THEN** `select` includes a `lower` function column aliased `dep`
- **AND** `group_by` includes `dep`

#### Scenario: Scalar-function select entries parse back into Group by

- **WHEN** a JSON query's `select` holds a scalar-function column from the allowlist
- **THEN** switching views shows it as a Group by function row, not an aggregate

### Requirement: Aggregate-mode HAVING builder

In `aggregate` mode the builder SHALL provide a Having section using the same nested group/condition builder as the Filter section, but whose selectable fields are the aggregate output names — the checked group-by fields, the bucket aliases, and the aggregate aliases. The built tree SHALL serialize to the query's `having` node under the same rules as the filter tree.

#### Scenario: Having references an aggregate alias

- **WHEN** an aggregate is aliased `total` and the user adds a Having condition `total gt 100`
- **THEN** the field selector for that condition offers `total`
- **AND** the serialized query includes a `having` node with that predicate

### Requirement: Sort keys

The Sort section SHALL let the user add, edit, and remove sort keys, each with a field, a direction (`asc` / `desc`), and an optional nulls ordering (default / nulls first / nulls last). The nulls select trigger SHALL carry a dimmed "Nulls:" prefix so its role is readable next to the direction select. In `row` mode the field options SHALL be the schema fields; in `aggregate` mode they SHALL be the aggregate output names (group-by columns, function-entry aliases, aggregate aliases). Fieldless sort keys SHALL be omitted, and `sort` SHALL be omitted entirely when no valid key remains; the nulls ordering SHALL be omitted when left at default.

#### Scenario: Sort key serializes

- **WHEN** the user adds a sort key on a field with direction `desc`
- **THEN** the serialized `sort` contains an item with that field and `dir: "desc"`

#### Scenario: Nulls control names itself

- **WHEN** the user inspects a sort key row
- **THEN** the nulls select shows a "Nulls:" prefix before the selected value

### Requirement: Paging

The Page section SHALL provide an "include page" toggle and a paging strategy selector (`offset` or `cursor`). For `offset` the controls SHALL be offset, limit, and an `include_total` toggle; for `cursor` the controls SHALL be a cursor value and a limit. The serialized `page` object SHALL match the selected strategy, and SHALL be omitted entirely when "include page" is off.

#### Scenario: Offset paging serializes

- **WHEN** "include page" is on with strategy `offset`, offset `0`, limit `25`, include_total off
- **THEN** `page` is `{ "type": "offset", "offset": 0, "limit": 25, "include_total": false }`

#### Scenario: Paging omitted when disabled

- **WHEN** "include page" is off
- **THEN** the serialized query has no `page` key

### Requirement: JSON view and copy

The JSON view SHALL render the current serialized `StructuredQuery` as JSON in a Monaco editor. Editing the JSON to a valid query the builder can represent SHALL parse it back into the builder state so the Builder view reflects the last such JSON; invalid JSON SHALL be flagged non-blockingly and SHALL disable Run while invalid. Valid JSON that the visual builder cannot represent (e.g. filter nesting deeper than two levels) SHALL remain fully editable and runnable: a non-blocking informational message SHALL state that the query cannot be shown in the visual builder, Run SHALL stay enabled and SHALL execute the JSON query as written, and the builder state SHALL NOT be updated from that JSON (switching to the Builder view is guarded by the written-mode confirmation). Entering the JSON view SHALL seed the editor from the current builder state. The Copy action SHALL copy the currently displayed query text (JSON for the Builder/JSON views, the SQL text for the SQL view).

#### Scenario: JSON reflects the form and round-trips

- **WHEN** the user edits the form, switches to the JSON view, and edits the JSON to valid content the builder can represent
- **THEN** the JSON initially mirrors the form
- **AND** the edited valid JSON is parsed back so the form reflects it

#### Scenario: Invalid JSON is flagged and blocks Run

- **WHEN** the JSON editor contains invalid JSON
- **THEN** a non-blocking invalid-JSON message is shown
- **AND** the Run action is disabled

#### Scenario: Unrepresentable JSON stays runnable

- **WHEN** the JSON editor contains a valid query whose filter nests deeper than two levels
- **THEN** a non-blocking message states the query cannot be shown in the visual builder
- **AND** the Run action stays enabled and executes the JSON query as written
- **AND** the builder state is not updated from that JSON

### Requirement: Aggregate validation warnings

While in `aggregate` mode the builder SHALL surface non-blocking warnings when: any aggregate lacks an alias; any Group by function entry lacks a source field or an alias; or the query has no group-by entries or aggregates. The warnings SHALL clear when resolved and SHALL NOT prevent running the query.

#### Scenario: Missing aggregate alias warns

- **WHEN** in aggregate mode an aggregate has no alias
- **THEN** a warning states that every aggregate needs an alias

#### Scenario: Missing function alias warns

- **WHEN** a Group by function entry has a field but no alias
- **THEN** a warning states that every group-by function needs an alias

#### Scenario: Warnings clear when resolved

- **WHEN** the aggregate gains an alias
- **THEN** the corresponding warning is no longer shown

### Requirement: Run query and result

The toolbar Run action SHALL execute the current query and render the result in the main results area. In the Builder view the query is the serialized `StructuredQuery` from the builder state; in the JSON view it is the query as written in the editor — both executed via a server action delegating to `analyticsDataApi.executeAction` (`/v1/queries/execute`). The result SHALL be shown as a grid whose columns are derived from the returned result (the result's declared columns when present, otherwise the union of keys across the returned rows), with object/array cell values stringified. Before any run, the results area SHALL show an empty state inviting the user to run the query. An empty result SHALL show an empty-state message. A failed run SHALL surface an error via the app's notification convention and SHALL NOT replace a previously shown result with a broken grid. Run SHALL be disabled until a schema is loaded and while the JSON view contains invalid (unparseable) JSON.

#### Scenario: Successful run renders a result grid

- **WHEN** the user runs a valid query that returns rows
- **THEN** the rows are shown in a grid in the main results area with a column per result column

#### Scenario: Empty state before the first run

- **WHEN** the page is open and no query has been run yet
- **THEN** the results area shows an empty state inviting the user to run the query

#### Scenario: Empty result

- **WHEN** a run returns no rows
- **THEN** an empty-state message is shown instead of a grid

#### Scenario: Failed run surfaces an error

- **WHEN** a run fails
- **THEN** an error notification is shown
- **AND** the previous result (if any) is not replaced by a broken grid

### Requirement: Result stat tiles

When a result is shown, the results area SHALL display a stat-tile row above the result with: the number of returned rows, the number of result columns (Fields), and — when the response includes a total count — the Total. The service computes `totalCount` only for row-mode offset paging with `include_total=true`, so the Include total toggle SHALL be offered only in row mode with offset paging, and aggregate/SQL results never show a Total tile. No timing tile SHALL be shown (the backend does not report query timing).

#### Scenario: Tiles reflect the result

- **WHEN** a run returns 12 rows with 5 columns and no total
- **THEN** the stat tiles show Rows 12 and Fields 5
- **AND** no Total tile is shown

#### Scenario: Total appears when reported

- **WHEN** a row-mode offset-paged run requested a total and the response includes one
- **THEN** a Total tile shows the reported total

#### Scenario: Include total is offered only where the service supports it

- **WHEN** the builder is in aggregate mode (or cursor paging is selected)
- **THEN** the Include total toggle is not shown

### Requirement: Result table and chart views

The results area SHALL offer a Table ⇄ Chart switcher. The Table view SHALL render the result grid. The Chart view SHALL render the result with ECharts and offer a chart-type control with four types — bar, line, pie, and scatter — plus two column selectors whose allowed columns and labels follow the selected type. The Chart view SHALL be available only when the shown result came from an aggregate-mode structured run with at least one group-by or bucket column; otherwise the Chart view SHALL show a hint that charts require an aggregate result with a group-by. Chart colors SHALL come from the shared chart color tokens.

For **bar** and **line**, the selectors SHALL be labeled X axis and Y axis: X over the executed query's group-by/bucket columns, Y over its aggregate columns (including the count column when present); defaults SHALL be the first dimension and the first aggregate. When every X value is numeric or date-like, the chart SHALL order the points along the X axis by that natural order (chronological/numeric ascending) regardless of the query's row order; mixed or plain-text X values keep row order. Long X-axis labels SHALL be truncated to a fixed label width with the full value available in the tooltip.

For **pie**, the same two selectors SHALL be labeled Category (group-by/bucket columns) and Value (aggregate columns). The chart SHALL show at most the top 10 categories by value as slices; any remaining categories SHALL be merged into a single "Other" slice.

For **scatter**, both selectors SHALL be labeled X axis and Y axis and SHALL offer the result's numeric columns — the group-by/bucket and aggregate columns whose every value is numeric or date-like. Each result row (one group) SHALL render as one point, with the row's dimension values available in the point tooltip; scatter SHALL NOT re-order rows. The scatter type SHALL be offered only when the result has at least two numeric columns; otherwise it is hidden from the chart-type control.

Switching chart type SHALL keep a column pick that is valid for the new type's selector and SHALL fall back to that selector's first valid default otherwise.

Everywhere the chart names a column — selector options, in-chart axis titles, and point tooltips — a group-by/bucket column SHALL display by its schema display name when the executed entity defines one (raw name otherwise); aggregate and scalar-function columns display by their user-authored alias. The labels SHALL follow the executed query's entity, not the currently selected source.

#### Scenario: Chart columns display by their schema display name

- **WHEN** an aggregate result grouped by a column whose schema defines a display name is charted
- **THEN** the axis selector and the chart axis title show the display name instead of the raw column name
- **AND** aggregate columns keep their user-authored aliases

#### Scenario: Chart renders for an aggregate result

- **WHEN** the shown result came from an aggregate run grouped by one field and the user selects the Chart view
- **THEN** a chart renders with the group-by column on X and an aggregate column on Y
- **AND** the user can switch between bar, line, pie, and scatter types

#### Scenario: Pie buckets the long tail into Other

- **WHEN** an aggregate result has more than 10 category values and the user selects the pie type
- **THEN** the pie shows the top 10 categories by value as slices
- **AND** the remaining categories are merged into a single "Other" slice

#### Scenario: Scatter plots one point per group

- **WHEN** an aggregate result grouped by one field has two aggregate columns and the user selects the scatter type
- **THEN** each group renders as one point with one aggregate on X and the other on Y
- **AND** the point tooltip shows the group's dimension value

#### Scenario: Scatter requires two numeric columns

- **WHEN** the shown aggregate result has only one numeric column
- **THEN** the scatter type is not offered in the chart-type control

#### Scenario: Column picks survive a compatible type switch

- **WHEN** the user configured Category and Value on a pie and switches to the bar type
- **THEN** the same columns stay selected as X and Y

#### Scenario: Comparable X values are ordered on the axis

- **WHEN** a top-N-by-count aggregate result has time-bucket X values and the user opens the Chart view
- **THEN** the chart shows the buckets in chronological order along the X axis
- **AND** the table keeps the query's row order

#### Scenario: Chart hint for non-aggregate results

- **WHEN** the shown result came from a row-mode or SQL run and the user selects the Chart view
- **THEN** a hint explains that charts require an aggregate result with a group-by

### Requirement: SQL view shows only a SQL editor

In the SQL view the rail SHALL render a SQL code editor filling the rail body, and SHALL NOT render the Mode, Filter, Select, Group by, Aggregate, Having, Sort, or Page sections. The source selector remains available in the toolbar. The editor SHALL provide SQL syntax highlighting (via the Monaco `sql` language). The Copy and Run actions SHALL remain available; Copy SHALL copy the SQL editor text.

#### Scenario: SQL view hides the builder sections

- **WHEN** the user selects the SQL view
- **THEN** a SQL editor is shown in the rail
- **AND** none of the Mode, Filter, Select, aggregate, Sort, or Page sections are shown

#### Scenario: SQL text is highlighted

- **WHEN** the user types a SQL statement in the SQL editor
- **THEN** the statement is rendered with SQL syntax highlighting

### Requirement: Schema-aware SQL autocomplete

The SQL editor SHALL offer completion suggestions derived from the loaded schema and a fixed SQL catalog: the loaded schema's field names (each annotated with its field type), the selected entity name (as the query's source/`FROM` target), and the supported SQL keywords and functions. Suggestions SHALL reflect the schema currently loaded, so changing the selected entity SHALL change the suggested field names and source name. The autocomplete SHALL NOT perform SQL validation.

#### Scenario: Schema fields are suggested

- **WHEN** the user triggers completion in the SQL editor with a schema loaded
- **THEN** the loaded schema's field names are offered as suggestions
- **AND** each field suggestion shows its field type
- **AND** the selected entity name is offered as the source

#### Scenario: Suggestions follow the selected entity

- **WHEN** the user selects a different entity and triggers completion
- **THEN** the suggested field names are those of the newly selected entity's schema

### Requirement: SQL execution via the SQL endpoint

Running a query in the SQL view SHALL execute the editor's SQL text against `POST /v1/queries/execute-sql` through a server action (`executeSqlQuery`) delegating to `analyticsDataApi.executeSqlAction`, sending the statement as `{ "sql": <text> }`. On success the returned rows SHALL be shown in the same result grid used by the structured Run. Because the SQL endpoint never returns a total count, no total SHALL be shown for SQL results. Run SHALL be disabled until a schema is loaded and while the SQL editor is empty.

#### Scenario: SQL run renders a result grid

- **WHEN** the user runs a valid SQL SELECT that returns rows
- **THEN** the request is sent to `/v1/queries/execute-sql` with body `{ "sql": <the editor text> }`
- **AND** the returned rows are shown in the result grid with a row-count meta line

#### Scenario: Run disabled for empty SQL

- **WHEN** the SQL editor is empty
- **THEN** the Run action is disabled

### Requirement: SQL validation is backend-authoritative

The SQL view SHALL NOT perform client-side SQL parsing or validation. When the backend rejects the SQL (a `400` — parse/validation failure or an unsupported construct such as a join, CTE, subquery, arithmetic, `CAST`, or a `LIMIT` above the maximum), the failure SHALL surface via the app's notification convention (error header/message), and a previously shown result SHALL NOT be replaced by a broken grid.

#### Scenario: Rejected SQL surfaces an error

- **WHEN** the user runs SQL that the backend rejects with a `400`
- **THEN** an error notification is shown with the backend's message
- **AND** any previously shown result is not replaced by a broken grid

### Requirement: SQL view state is an independent buffer

The Query Builder SHALL keep the SQL editor text as its own buffer. Entering the SQL view SHALL seed the editor with SQL generated from the current builder query (including the toolbar time bound and the implicit count) when the buffer is empty or still matches the last generated text; user-edited SQL SHALL never be overwritten by generation. The SQL text SHALL NEVER be parsed back into the builder form state. Switching between the SQL and JSON views SHALL NOT prompt and SHALL leave both buffers intact.

#### Scenario: Entering SQL compiles the builder query

- **WHEN** the user opens the SQL view without prior SQL edits
- **THEN** the editor is pre-filled with a SQL statement generated from the current builder query

#### Scenario: SQL text persists across written-mode switches

- **WHEN** the user edits SQL, switches to the JSON view, and switches back to the SQL view
- **THEN** the SQL editor shows the previously edited text unchanged

### Requirement: Switching from a written mode to the Builder is guarded

SQL and JSON are "written" modes: they can hold queries the visual builder cannot display (edited SQL text; JSON with e.g. filter nesting deeper than two levels). When the user switches from a written mode to the Builder view while the current written query cannot be shown in the builder (SQL: buffer edited away from the last generated text; JSON: valid but unrepresentable query), a confirmation popup (danger variant) SHALL warn that switching will drop the current query and reset the builder to its starting point. Confirming SHALL discard the written query (clear the SQL buffer / discard the JSON edits), reset the builder state to its initial defaults for the selected entity, and switch to the Builder view. Cancelling SHALL keep the user in the written mode with the query intact. Switching to the Builder SHALL NOT prompt when nothing would be lost (empty or unedited generated SQL; JSON that round-trips into the builder).

#### Scenario: Leaving SQL with edits asks for confirmation

- **WHEN** the user edits SQL and selects the Builder view
- **THEN** a confirmation popup warns that the current query will be dropped and the builder reset

#### Scenario: Confirming drops the written query and resets the builder

- **WHEN** the confirmation popup is shown and the user confirms
- **THEN** the view switches to the Builder view
- **AND** the written query is discarded
- **AND** the builder state is reset to its initial defaults for the selected entity

#### Scenario: Cancelling keeps the written query

- **WHEN** the confirmation popup is shown and the user cancels
- **THEN** the user remains in the written mode
- **AND** the written query text is unchanged

#### Scenario: Representable JSON switches silently

- **WHEN** the JSON editor holds a valid query the builder can represent and the user selects the Builder view
- **THEN** no confirmation is shown
- **AND** the builder reflects that query

### Requirement: Tables catalog page

The Tables page SHALL render the tables the page fetched as a grid with columns for name, type, description, and column count. Clicking a row (other than the actions column) SHALL navigate to that table's detail page. Each row SHALL offer a delete action whose confirmation dialog uses the danger (red confirm) variant. The header SHALL provide actions to create a source table and to create an enrichment table. After a successful create or delete the catalog SHALL refresh client-side.

#### Scenario: Catalog lists tables with navigation

- **WHEN** the catalog renders with tables
- **THEN** each table appears as a row with its name, type, description, and column count
- **AND** clicking a row navigates to that table's detail page

#### Scenario: Delete a table

- **WHEN** the user activates a row's delete action and confirms in the red confirmation dialog
- **THEN** the table is deleted and the catalog refreshes
- **AND** a failure surfaces an error notification without navigating away

### Requirement: Create table (source or enrichment)

Creating a table SHALL open a form popup that is mounted only while open, so closing discards its state without a manual reset; the form SHALL be held as a single object seeded when the popup opens (enrichment defaults derived from the first source table). A **source** table SHALL collect a name, optional description, a repeatable set of columns (source name, exposed name, type, nullable, optional tag), an optional ordering key chosen from the declared column source names, and an optional partition consisting of a column and a granularity. The partition column SHALL be restricted to temporal (date/timestamp) columns and the granularity SHALL be one of a fixed set (day/month/year). An **enrichment** table SHALL collect a name, optional description, a source table, and a grain key chosen from the selected source table's ordering key; changing the source table SHALL reset the grain key. Submit SHALL build the type-discriminated create payload and show a success or error notification.

#### Scenario: Popup state is discarded on close

- **WHEN** the user opens the create popup, edits fields, and closes it
- **THEN** re-opening the popup shows a fresh, empty form

#### Scenario: Partition column limited to temporal columns

- **WHEN** the user is defining a source table's partition
- **THEN** only date/timestamp columns are offered as the partition column
- **AND** the granularity is one of day/month/year

#### Scenario: Enrichment grain key follows the source table

- **WHEN** the user changes the selected source table
- **THEN** the grain-key options become that source's ordering-key columns
- **AND** the grain key resets to that source's first ordering key

### Requirement: Table detail column schema management

The Table detail page SHALL show the table's columns in a grid (name, source name, type, tag, display name, description, nullable rendered as a true/false value); long display name/description values SHALL be truncated with the full value reachable via an ellipsis tooltip. Each column row SHALL offer a per-column action menu with **edit** and **delete (drop)** actions. The column name SHALL also be editable inline in the grid.

The edit action SHALL open a unified edit modal seeded with the column's current name, display name, and tag. The description SHALL NOT be offered for editing while the backend has no description-edit operation (the backend silently ignores unknown patch operations, which would make a save appear to do nothing); the field joins the modal once that operation ships. The name field SHALL be required (submit disabled while blank) and SHALL be disabled for columns the backend does not allow to rename (grain-key, ordering-key, and `_`-prefixed system columns) while the metadata fields remain editable. Blank display name or tag values SHALL be valid input meaning "clear the value". On submit the modal SHALL diff the form against the original column and send a **single** schema patch containing only the changed operations (`rename`, `retag`, `set_display_name`); when a rename is included, the metadata operations SHALL reference the new (post-rename) column name. Submit SHALL be disabled when no field changed.

Adding columns SHALL be available from the header via a form popup reusing the column-row editor. Every schema change SHALL be sent as a schema patch to `updateTableSchema`, and on success the detail view SHALL refresh from the server. The header SHALL also offer deleting the whole table with a danger (red confirm) dialog, returning to the catalog on success.

#### Scenario: Inline rename patches the schema

- **WHEN** the user edits a column's name in the grid to a new non-empty value
- **THEN** a rename schema patch is sent and the grid refreshes with the server state

#### Scenario: Combined edit sends one patch with post-rename names

- **WHEN** the user renames `total_money` to `total_cost` and sets its display name to "Total money spend" in the edit modal and submits
- **THEN** a single schema patch is sent containing a rename from `total_money` to `total_cost` and a set_display_name targeting `total_cost`
- **AND** the grid refreshes with the server state

#### Scenario: Only changed fields become operations

- **WHEN** the user changes only the display name and leaves name and tag untouched
- **THEN** the patch contains only a set_display_name operation

#### Scenario: Blank metadata clears the value

- **WHEN** the user clears the display name field and submits
- **THEN** a set_display_name operation with an empty value is sent, clearing the stored display name

#### Scenario: Restricted columns cannot be renamed but keep metadata editable

- **WHEN** the user opens the edit modal for a grain-key or ordering-key column
- **THEN** the name input is disabled
- **AND** display name and tag remain editable

#### Scenario: Drop a column

- **WHEN** the user chooses delete from a column's action menu
- **THEN** a drop schema patch is sent and the column is removed after refresh

#### Scenario: Add columns

- **WHEN** the user adds one or more valid columns in the add-columns popup and submits
- **THEN** an add schema patch is sent and the new columns appear after refresh

### Requirement: Table detail row writes

The Table detail page SHALL let the user write rows by entering a JSON array of row objects in a popup editor. The input SHALL be validated as a JSON array before sending; invalid or non-array input SHALL surface an error and SHALL NOT issue a request. Valid rows SHALL be posted via `addRows`, with a success or error notification.

#### Scenario: Valid rows are inserted

- **WHEN** the user enters a valid JSON array of objects and submits
- **THEN** the rows are posted to the table and a success notification is shown

#### Scenario: Invalid rows JSON is rejected

- **WHEN** the user enters text that is not a JSON array
- **THEN** an error is shown and no request is issued

### Requirement: System-owned tables are read-only

The catalog and detail views SHALL reflect the table's server-provided `system` flag. System-owned tables are seeded server-side and reject every modifying request (`409 table_is_system`), so the UI SHALL NOT offer modify actions for them: in the catalog the row's delete action SHALL be hidden and a System indicator SHALL be shown; in the detail view the delete-table / write-rows / add-columns actions and the per-column edit/drop actions and inline rename SHALL be suppressed, replaced by a read-only indicator. System tables SHALL remain fully viewable and navigable, including their column display names and descriptions.

#### Scenario: System table in the catalog

- **WHEN** the catalog lists a table whose `system` flag is true
- **THEN** the row shows a System indicator
- **AND** the row's delete action is not offered

#### Scenario: System table detail is read-only

- **WHEN** the user opens a system table's detail page
- **THEN** the delete-table, write-rows, and add-columns actions are absent and a read-only indicator is shown
- **AND** the column grid offers no edit/drop actions and no inline editing
- **AND** the table, its columns, and their display names and descriptions remain viewable
