## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Conversations grid with server-side ordering and per-column filtering

The conversations view SHALL render a grid of seven visible columns — conversation, project, user, turns,
activity, tokens, cost — plus the Rating column.

A column SHALL offer a sort or a filter control **only** when the control can be answered over the whole
result. That is the case exactly when the column is backed by a stored field of the `conversations` entity,
because the control then becomes part of the query. Sorting and filtering SHALL therefore be resolved by the
backend, and the grid MUST NOT narrow or reorder the pages it already holds: those pages are a slice of the
result, so narrowing them client-side would report a slice as the complete answer.

| Column | Sort | Filter |
|---|---|---|
| conversation (`chat_id`) | yes | text |
| project (`project_id`) | yes | text |
| user (`user_hash`) | yes | text |
| turns (`turn_count`) | yes | number |
| activity (`last_request_time`) | yes | none |
| tokens (`total_tokens`) | yes | number |
| cost (`total_price`) | yes | number |
| Rating | no | no |

The Rating column SHALL offer neither. It is composed from `rate_analytics` lookups resolved for the page
just returned and has no field on the queried entity, so any ordering or narrowing of it could only describe
the rows already on screen. The feedback control is the filter for that dimension.

The activity column SHALL be sortable but SHALL NOT offer a filter. The page's time-period control already
predicates on `last_request_time`, and a second control over the same dimension would let a filter appear to
widen a range the period clips.

Filter controls SHALL offer only operators the query language can express. An operator with no equivalent —
notably prefix and suffix matching — MUST NOT be offered, since an offered operator that cannot be translated
either fails or silently returns the wrong rows. Text columns SHALL offer contains, does-not-contain, equals
and not-equals; number columns SHALL additionally offer the four magnitude comparisons. An incomplete filter
entry — an operator chosen with no value — SHALL contribute no predicate rather than a predicate against an
empty value.

Column filters SHALL compose with the page's own controls as a conjunction: the search term, the time period,
the feedback narrowing and every column filter SHALL all hold for a returned conversation. The page's filter
state MUST NOT be written into the grid's filter model, and the grid's filter model MUST NOT be read as the
page's filter state; they are separate inputs to one query.

A change to the sort or to any column filter SHALL discard the pages already fetched and restart from the
first page of the new result, exactly as a search, period or feedback change does. The whole-result
conversation count and cost SHALL be re-resolved under the same predicates, so the summary cannot describe a
different result than the rows.

When no column sort is applied the result SHALL be ordered most recent last activity first. Clearing a
column's sort SHALL return to that default rather than leaving an arbitrary order.

The conversation column SHALL keep the full conversation id reachable when it is too long to display, since
real ids are not uniformly short and can run to hundreds of characters. Truncation MUST NOT be the only
presentation of the value. The user column SHALL keep its value reachable on the same terms.

The user column SHALL show the conversation's `user_hash`, labelled the way the conversation detail page
labels it. The value is a de-identified surrogate rather than an identity, so the column SHALL NOT be
presented as a name or an address.

While the first page of a new sort, filter or page-control state is in flight the view SHALL show a loading
indicator, so the empty state cannot flash between a change and its rows. When the result holds no rows the
view SHALL render a no-data state rather than an empty grid body.

Numeric and currency columns SHALL carry the same formatting these value types carry elsewhere in the app.
The grid SHALL use a taller row than the app's shared default, since its cells stack two lines.

The page header SHALL be the title alone, with no status badge of its own — the Analytics navigation group
already marks the whole area as preview.

Rows SHALL be openable, navigating to that conversation's detail view. The grid SHALL indicate that its rows
are openable rather than leaving the affordance undiscoverable, and SHALL honour the app's convention for
opening a row in a new tab. The conversation id SHALL be URL-encoded into the detail address, since real ids
contain path separators and percent-encoded text.

The grid SHALL carry a provenance band above the column headers, grouping every column under the data source
it comes from, and a column MUST NOT be able to leave its group when moved.

Every column SHALL belong to exactly one group: an unattributed column would imply a provenance the page has
not stated. Group labels SHALL name the actual source of the columns beneath them and MUST NOT overstate it —
a column read from a source table MUST NOT be labelled as enrichment-derived, and no group SHALL be attributed
to a source the page does not query. Each group SHALL carry a tooltip naming its source precisely. Colours
SHALL come from theme tokens, never literal values, and every provenance value SHALL map to a colour, so a
newly added one cannot render unstyled.

The band and the column-header row SHALL each carry their own height, and the band label SHALL be separated
from the column header beneath it.

#### Scenario: Sorting a field-backed column re-queries from the first page

- **WHEN** the operator sorts the cost column descending
- **THEN** a new request is issued carrying that sort key with a first-page offset
- **AND** the pages already fetched are discarded
- **AND** the rows shown are the result's ordering, not a reordering of the rows already held

#### Scenario: Clearing a sort returns to the default ordering

- **WHEN** the operator clears the sort on a column
- **THEN** the result is ordered most recent last activity first

#### Scenario: A column filter becomes a query predicate

- **WHEN** the operator applies a contains filter on the project column
- **THEN** a new request is issued carrying that predicate with a first-page offset
- **AND** the returned rows are the whole result's matches, not the previously loaded rows narrowed

#### Scenario: Column filters compose with the page's controls

- **WHEN** a column filter is applied while a search term, a time period and a feedback state are active
- **THEN** the request carries all of them, and a returned conversation satisfies every one

#### Scenario: The summary follows the sort and filter state

- **WHEN** a column filter is applied
- **THEN** the whole-result conversation count and cost are re-resolved under the same predicates

#### Scenario: Rating offers no sort and no filter

- **WHEN** the operator inspects the Rating column header
- **THEN** it offers no sort affordance and no filter control
- **AND** clicking it does not change the row order

#### Scenario: Activity sorts but does not filter

- **WHEN** the operator inspects the activity column header
- **THEN** a sort affordance is offered
- **AND** no filter control is offered

#### Scenario: Untranslatable operators are not offered

- **WHEN** the operator opens a text column's filter
- **THEN** the operator list offers contains, does-not-contain, equals and not-equals
- **AND** it offers no prefix or suffix matching option

#### Scenario: An operator with no value contributes nothing

- **WHEN** a filter entry has an operator selected and its value left empty
- **THEN** the request carries no predicate for that column

#### Scenario: Every column is attributed to a source

- **WHEN** the grid renders
- **THEN** a band above the column headers groups the columns by source
- **AND** every column belongs to exactly one group
- **AND** the conversation, project, user, turns, activity, tokens and cost columns are attributed to
  `conversations`, and the Rating column to `rate_analytics`

#### Scenario: Groups survive column movement

- **WHEN** a column is dragged
- **THEN** it cannot be moved out of its provenance group

#### Scenario: A long conversation id stays reachable

- **WHEN** a conversation id is too long to fit its column
- **THEN** the cell truncates it and the full value remains reachable

#### Scenario: Opening a row navigates to the conversation

- **WHEN** a grid row is opened
- **THEN** that conversation's detail view is navigated to, with its id URL-encoded in the address

#### Scenario: Opening a row in a new tab

- **WHEN** a grid row is opened with the app's new-tab modifier
- **THEN** the conversation's detail view opens in a new tab and the grid keeps its fetched pages

#### Scenario: Loading replaces the grid rather than the empty state showing

- **WHEN** the first page of a new sort or filter state is in flight
- **THEN** a loading indicator renders in place of the grid
- **AND** the no-data content is not shown

#### Scenario: Empty result renders the empty state

- **WHEN** the result holds zero conversations
- **THEN** the no-data content renders instead of an empty grid body

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Conversation list query over the conversations entity

The system SHALL provide `buildConversationListQuery({ range, search, chatIds, sort, columnFilters, offset })`
in `src/utils/analytics/conversations-queries.ts` returning a `StructuredQuery` over the entity
`conversations` in **row mode**. The conversation rollup is materialized by the analytics service — one row
per `chat_id`, produced by an aggregate pipeline over `dial_usage_log` — so the query SHALL read stored
columns and MUST NOT group or aggregate.

The select SHALL name exactly the columns the page renders, by their entity field names:

| Field | Renders as |
|---|---|
| `chat_id` | conversation |
| `project_id` | project |
| `user_hash` | user |
| `turn_count` | turns |
| `total_tokens` | tokens |
| `total_price` | cost |
| `last_request_time` | activity (relative) |
| `first_request_time` | activity (span) |

`turn_count` is the pipeline's `count()` over usage-log rows for the conversation, which includes non-LLM
spans such as embedding, MCP and routing calls. It is therefore **not** a count of distinct request traces,
and user-facing copy MUST NOT claim it is. An exact turn count is not expressible in a rollup: a pipeline
measure is one aggregate function over one column with no `distinct` option.

The filter SHALL be `and[ ge(last_request_time, startMs), le(last_request_time, endMs) ]`. The time bounds
SHALL apply to `last_request_time`, so a selected period means *conversations whose last activity falls in the
period*. The query MUST NOT carry an empty-`chat_id` guard: the pipeline's own membership predicate excludes
those rows, so every row of the entity has a non-empty id.

When a non-blank `search` term is supplied the filter SHALL additionally carry one `or` group of two `ico`
predicates matching `chat_id` and `project_id`. The term SHALL be trimmed, and a blank or whitespace-only term
SHALL add no predicate at all rather than an `ico` against the empty string, which would match every row at
the cost of a scan. Both targets are base columns of the entity, so no select-alias restriction applies.

Search MUST NOT reach message content: no column of `conversations` carries it, and the only column that
could — `dial_usage_log.request_body` — is catalogued `sensitive` and belongs to a different entity. Search
SHALL NOT reach `user_hash` either: selecting the column for display does not make a surrogate a useful
free-text target, and a partial-match predicate over it would cost a scan for a value operators paste whole —
the user column's own filter is the exact-value input for it. The search affordance SHALL name only the fields
search actually reaches.

When `chatIds` is non-empty the filter SHALL additionally carry `in(chat_id, chatIds)`, which is how the
feedback filter narrows the result.

When `columnFilters` is non-empty the filter SHALL additionally carry one predicate per entry, conjoined with
everything above. Each entry names a field of the entity and an operator the language expresses; an entry
naming a field the entity does not carry, or an operator with no equivalent, SHALL be rejected rather than
translated to an approximation. A range entry SHALL become a `ge` and an `le` predicate on the same field.
Predicate value types SHALL follow the field's type: string fields carry string literals, count fields
integers, price fields decimals, and timestamp fields epoch-millisecond literals.

The sort SHALL be the caller's sort keys, if any, followed by `{ chat_id, asc }`; with no caller sort keys it
SHALL be `[{ last_request_time, desc }, { chat_id, asc }]`. The trailing `chat_id asc` tiebreaker is required
in every case: the service appends no implicit tiebreaker, so without it a paged result is not stable across
requests and a row could be skipped or repeated between pages. A caller sort key SHALL carry an explicit
nulls ordering placing nulls last, so a column holding nulls orders deterministically rather than relying on
the backend's default. A sort key naming a field the entity does not carry SHALL be rejected: sorting by a
value the query cannot name would silently fall back to an unstated order.

The page SHALL be `{ type: 'offset', offset, limit, include_total: true }`. A limit above 1000 SHALL never be
sent — the service rejects it with HTTP 400 and does not clamp.

The query SHALL reference no column absent from the entity's role-visible schema; `conversations` exposes no
`sensitive` column, so every selected field is visible to a read-only admin. `user_hash` is catalogued
non-sensitive — the analytics service exposes it as a de-identified surrogate — so selecting, sorting or
filtering on it requires no elevated role.

#### Scenario: Query reads the conversations entity in row mode

- **WHEN** `buildConversationListQuery` is called with a time range
- **THEN** the query targets entity `conversations` with `mode: 'row'`
- **AND** it carries no `group_by` and no aggregate function expression
- **AND** its select names `chat_id`, `project_id`, `user_hash`, `turn_count`, `total_tokens`, `total_price`,
  `last_request_time` and `first_request_time`

#### Scenario: Time bounds apply to last activity as epoch-millisecond literals

- **WHEN** the query is built for a range
- **THEN** the filter contains a `ge` and an `le` predicate on `last_request_time`
- **AND** each carries `value_type: 'timestamp'` with the bound's epoch-millisecond count as a string

#### Scenario: No empty-id guard is emitted

- **WHEN** the query is built
- **THEN** the filter carries no comparison on `chat_id` against the empty string

#### Scenario: A search term becomes an OR of contains predicates

- **WHEN** the query is built with a search term
- **THEN** the filter carries one additional `or` group of exactly two `ico` predicates
- **AND** they match `chat_id` and `project_id`, each against the trimmed term
- **AND** no predicate matches `user_hash`

#### Scenario: A blank search term adds no predicate

- **WHEN** the query is built with an empty or whitespace-only search term
- **THEN** the filter carries only the time bounds

#### Scenario: A column filter becomes a conjoined predicate

- **WHEN** the query is built with a column filter entry on `total_price` above a value
- **THEN** the filter carries a `gt` predicate on `total_price` conjoined with the time bounds
- **AND** a range entry instead produces a `ge` and an `le` predicate on that field

#### Scenario: Caller sort keys precede the tiebreaker

- **WHEN** the query is built with a sort key on `total_tokens` descending
- **THEN** the sort is that key followed by `chat_id` ascending
- **AND** the caller's key carries a nulls-last ordering

#### Scenario: Sort ends with a stable tiebreaker

- **WHEN** the query is built with no caller sort keys
- **THEN** the sort is `last_request_time` descending followed by `chat_id` ascending
- **AND** `chat_id` ascending is the final sort entry

#### Scenario: An unknown field is rejected rather than approximated

- **WHEN** the query is built with a sort key or column filter naming a field the entity does not carry
- **THEN** that input is rejected rather than translated

#### Scenario: Search leaves the rest of the query untouched

- **WHEN** the query is built with a search term
- **THEN** its select, sort and page are identical to the same query built without one
- **AND** the time bounds are unchanged
- **AND** `having` is absent

### Requirement: Server-side paging with an exact result total

The conversations page SHALL fetch its rows one page at a time from the backend and SHALL request the result
total with `include_total: true`. The analytics service populates `totalCount` for row-mode queries only; the
entity is read in row mode, so the total is available and SHALL be used rather than inferred from the number
of rows returned.

The page SHALL reuse the application's existing server-paged grid mechanism and its shared page size rather
than introducing a second paging pattern. Successive pages SHALL be requested by advancing the query's
`offset` while every other part of the query — filter, sort, limit — stays identical, so paging cannot change
which conversations are in the result, only which slice of it is delivered.

The grid SHALL be told the total number of rows once it is known, so it stops requesting pages at the end of
the result instead of probing past it. A request for a page beyond the result SHALL yield no rows and SHALL
NOT be reported as a failure.

Any filter change SHALL discard the pages already fetched and restart from the first page: a filter change
produces a different result set, so an already-fetched page of the previous one is not a prefix of it. A
change to the sort SHALL restart paging on the same grounds: a page of a differently ordered result is not a
prefix of the new one either, even though the set of conversations is unchanged. A change to any column filter
SHALL restart paging as a filter change.

Ratings SHALL be resolved for each page as it arrives, restricted to the conversations that page contains.

The result total SHALL never be presented as a lower bound. Because the total is exact, the summary MUST NOT
render an approximation marker such as a trailing "+", and MUST NOT hint that the figures understate the
result.

#### Scenario: The first page requests a total

- **WHEN** the page loads its first page of conversations
- **THEN** the query's offset page sets `include_total: true`
- **AND** the returned `totalCount` is used as the result total

#### Scenario: Scrolling fetches the next page unchanged but for its offset

- **WHEN** the operator scrolls past the rows already loaded
- **THEN** a further query is issued with a larger `offset`
- **AND** its filter, sort and limit are identical to the previous page's

#### Scenario: The grid stops at the end of the result

- **WHEN** the last page of the result has been delivered
- **THEN** the grid is told the total row count and issues no further page request

#### Scenario: A filter change restarts paging

- **WHEN** the operator changes the search term, the time period or the feedback state after scrolling
- **THEN** the previously fetched pages are discarded
- **AND** the next request is for the first page of the new result

#### Scenario: A sort change restarts paging

- **WHEN** the operator changes a column's sort after scrolling
- **THEN** the previously fetched pages are discarded
- **AND** the next request is for the first page, carrying the new sort

#### Scenario: A column filter change restarts paging

- **WHEN** the operator applies or clears a column filter after scrolling
- **THEN** the previously fetched pages are discarded
- **AND** the next request is for the first page, carrying the new predicates

#### Scenario: Ratings follow each page

- **WHEN** a page of conversations arrives
- **THEN** the rating counts are resolved for exactly the conversations on that page

### Requirement: Feedback filter resolved through a second query

The conversations page SHALL provide a feedback filter with exactly four mutually exclusive states — all,
positive, negative, and rated — defaulting to all. It SHALL reuse the shared `DialSegmentedControl`.

Feedback lives in the `rate_analytics` entity, which the conversation rollup does not include, and the
structured-query DSL accepts a single `entity` with no join construct. A feedback filter SHALL therefore be
resolved as two queries: first a candidate query over `rate_analytics` returning the `chat_id` values carrying
the requested feedback, then the conversation query over `conversations` narrowed to those ids with an `in`
predicate. Both SHALL be issued server-side with the caller's token, and the `all` state SHALL issue only the
conversation query, so the default path costs exactly one request per page.

The candidate query SHALL be aggregate mode over `rate_analytics` grouped by `chat_id`, carry the same time
bounds as the conversation query and an empty-id guard, and select `chat_id` plus `max(request_time)`. It SHALL
be ordered by most recent rating, so that if the candidate set reaches its limit the ids retained are the most
recently rated ones. Its limit SHALL NOT exceed 1000, the service's hard maximum.

The candidate set SHALL be resolved once per filter state and reused across the pages of that result, rather
than re-queried per page: the narrowing is a property of the filter, not of the page.

When the candidate set reaches that limit the view SHALL state that the feedback-filtered result may be
incomplete and that the conversations shown are the most recently rated ones. The cap truncates the result
regardless of how it is ordered, and the ordering is the operator's to choose, so a truncated result MUST NOT
be presented as the complete set of conversations carrying that feedback. The disclosure SHALL be visible
while the capped filter state is applied and SHALL clear when the filter state no longer reaches the cap.

The rate predicates SHALL be:

| State | Predicate |
|---|---|
| positive | `gt(rate, 0)` |
| negative | `le(rate, 0)` |
| rated | `ne(rate, null)` |

`rate` is signed: DIAL sends `1` for a like and `-1` for a dislike, and the service normalizes a boolean
`false` to `0` and anything else to null. The negative state SHALL therefore match everything at or below
zero rather than testing for a value below zero, so a `false` normalized to `0` counts as negative alongside a
`-1` dislike. Neither comparison SHALL carry a companion null guard: SQL three-valued logic already evaluates
both to NULL for an unrated row, so an unrated conversation matches neither. `rated` SHALL be its own
`IS NOT NULL` predicate rather than a union of the other two, so a rating outside the positive/negative split
still counts as rated, and SHALL use `ne` — the only operator besides `eq` that accepts a null right operand.

When the candidate query returns no ids the page SHALL return no rows **without** issuing the conversation
query: the service rejects an empty `in` list with HTTP 400, and "nothing carries this feedback" is already
the complete answer. Blank ids SHALL be dropped from the candidate set. When the candidate query fails, the
failure SHALL propagate and the conversation query MUST NOT run.

#### Scenario: Feedback filter issues the candidate query then the narrowed query

- **WHEN** a feedback state other than all is selected
- **THEN** a query against `rate_analytics` is issued first, carrying the state's rate predicate
- **AND** a query against `conversations` follows, restricted to the returned ids by an `in` predicate
- **AND** both carry the caller's token

#### Scenario: The default state costs one query per page

- **WHEN** the feedback filter is in its all state
- **THEN** only the conversation query is issued and it carries no `in` predicate

#### Scenario: A capped candidate set is disclosed

- **WHEN** the candidate query returns its full limit of ids
- **THEN** the view states that the result may be incomplete and covers the most recently rated
  conversations

#### Scenario: The disclosure clears when the filter state no longer caps

- **WHEN** the operator changes to a filter state whose candidate set is below the limit
- **THEN** the incompleteness disclosure is no longer shown

#### Scenario: No conversation carries the feedback

- **WHEN** the candidate query returns no ids
- **THEN** no rows are returned
- **AND** the conversation query is not issued

#### Scenario: The candidate query fails

- **WHEN** the candidate query returns a failure
- **THEN** that failure is returned and the conversation query is not issued

#### Scenario: Negative feedback includes a zero rating

- **WHEN** the negative state is selected
- **THEN** its predicate matches ratings less than or equal to zero, covering both a `-1` dislike and a
  `false` thumb normalized to `0`

#### Scenario: Rated covers both thumbs

- **WHEN** the rated state is selected
- **THEN** its predicate is a null comparison on `rate`, matching every conversation the two thumb states
  match and any rating outside that split

#### Scenario: Feedback composes with the other filters

- **WHEN** a feedback state is selected while a search term and a time range are applied
- **THEN** the narrowed conversation query still carries the search predicates and the time bounds

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Read-only conversations grid

**Reason**: The requirement forbade sorting and per-column filtering outright. Its rationale was that a column
filter narrows only the pages already fetched — an argument against client-side filtering, not against
filtering. With sort keys and predicates carried in the query, a control applies to the whole result and the
objection no longer holds. Because two of the requirement's scenarios asserted the absence of the very
affordances now added, it is replaced rather than modified.

**Migration**: Replaced by "Conversations grid with server-side ordering and per-column filtering", which
retains every other guarantee — the provenance band and its grouping rules, openable rows and the new-tab
convention, reachable long values, the loading and no-data states, row height, formatting, and the header
without a status badge — and adds the sort and filter contract, including which columns are excluded from it
and why.
